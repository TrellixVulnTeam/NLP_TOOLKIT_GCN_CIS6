virus known as COVID-19 originated outside China. It may have originated in the U.S. that COVID-19 may have been brought to China by the U.S. Army ,0
"The available evidence indicates coronavirus originated in animals in China late last year and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory as has been alleged, the World Health Organization said Tuesday in a news briefing in Geneva. ""It is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin,"" WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said.The global health body's remarks follow confirmation from President Donald Trump last week that his administration is investigating whether coronavirus originated in a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease emerged. Speculation about how coronavirus may have escaped the Wuhan Institute of Virology has circulated among right-wing bloggers and conservative media pundits. 
Coronavirus and college:Coronavirus displaced millions of college students, who worry how they're going to voteOne suggestion that the virus could be man-made and linked to a Chinese biowarfare program has been widely dismissed by scientists. Under a second scenario, the virus was naturally occurring – from a bat, say – but accidentally escaped the research facility because of poor safety protocols.Both notions are based on circumstantial evidence such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology's history of studying coronaviruses in bats, the lab's proximity to where some of the infections were first diagnosed and China's lax safety record in its labs. Chaib said there remain questions over how precisely coronavirus jumped the species barrier to humans, but an intermediate animal host is the most likely explanation. She said the coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, ""most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats.""The Trump administration accused the WHO of a catalog of errors over its response to the pandemic, including failing to adequately prepare for the outbreak, raising the alarm too slowly and naively accepting flawed information from China.The WHO disputed all the allegations. Most public health experts don't agree with the Trump administration's specific criticisms of the WHO, although they acknowledge that the organization needs reform and lacks transparency. The Washington Post reported over the weekend that American officials working with the WHO sent back information to the White House about the spread of the virus in the crucial early days of January.",1
"Maximum-security biolab is part of plan to build network of BSL-4 facilities across China.Editors’ note, January 2020: Many stories have promoted an unverified theory that the Wuhan lab discussed in this article played a role in the coronavirus outbreak that began in December 2019. Nature knows of no evidence that this is true; scientists believe the most likely source of the coronavirus to be an animal market.A laboratory in Wuhan is on the cusp of being cleared to work with the world’s most dangerous pathogens. The move is part of a plan to build between five and seven biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) labs across the Chinese mainland by 2025, and has generated much excitement, as well as some concerns.Some scientists outside China worry about pathogens escaping, and the addition of a biological dimension to geopolitical tensions between China and other nations. But Chinese microbiologists are celebrating their entrance to the elite cadre empowered to wrestle with the world’s greatest biological threats.“It will offer more opportunities for Chinese researchers, and our contribution on the BSL‑4-level pathogens will benefit the world,” says George Gao, director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology in Beijing. There are already two BSL-4 labs in Taiwan, but the National Bio-safety Laboratory, Wuhan, would be the first on the Chinese mainland.The lab was certified as meeting the standards and criteria of BSL-4 by the China National Accreditation Service for Conformity Assessment (CNAS) in January. The CNAS examined the lab’s infrastructure, equipment and management, says a CNAS representative, paving the way for the Ministry of Health to give its approval. A representative from the ministry says it will move slowly and cautiously; if the assessment goes smoothly, it could approve the laboratory by the end of June.
BSL-4 is the highest level of biocontainment: its criteria include filtering air and treating water and waste before they leave the laboratory, and stipulating that researchers change clothes and shower before and after using lab facilities. Such labs are often controversial. The first BSL-4 lab in Japan was built in 1981, but operated with lower-risk pathogens until 2015, when safety concerns were finally overcome.The expansion of BSL-4-lab networks in the United States and Europe over the past 15 years — with more than a dozen now in operation or under construction in each region — also met with resistance, including questions about the need for so many facilities.The Wuhan lab cost 300 million yuan (US$44 million), and to allay safety concerns it was built far above the flood plain and with the capacity to withstand a magnitude-7 earthquake, although the area has no history of strong earthquakes. It will focus on the control of emerging diseases, store purified viruses and act as a World Health Organization ‘reference laboratory’ linked to similar labs around the world. “It will be a key node in the global biosafety-lab network,” says lab director Yuan Zhiming.The Chinese Academy of Sciences approved the construction of a BSL-4 laboratory in 2003, and the epidemic of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) around the same time lent the project momentum. The lab was designed and constructed with French assistance as part of a 2004 cooperative agreement on the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases. But the complexity of the project, China’s lack of experience, difficulty in maintaining funding and long government approval procedures meant that construction wasn’t finished until the end of 2014.The lab’s first project will be to study the BSL-3 pathogen that causes Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever: a deadly tick-borne virus that affects livestock across the world, including in northwest China, and that can jump to people.Future plans include studying the pathogen that causes SARS, which also doesn’t require a BSL-4 lab, before moving on to Ebola and the West African Lassa virus, which do. Some one million Chinese people work in Africa; the country needs to be ready for any eventuality, says Yuan. “Viruses don’t know borders.”
Gao travelled to Sierra Leone during the recent Ebola outbreak, allowing his team to report the speed with which the virus mutated into new strains1. The Wuhan lab will give his group a chance to study how such viruses cause disease, and to develop treatments based on antibodies and small molecules, he says.The opportunities for international collaboration, meanwhile, will aid the genetic analysis and epidemiology of emergent diseases. “The world is facing more new emerging viruses, and we need more contribution from China,” says Gao. In particular, the emergence of zoonotic viruses — those that jump to humans from animals, such as SARS or Ebola — is a concern, says Bruno Lina, director of the VirPath virology lab in Lyon, France.Many staff from the Wuhan lab have been training at a BSL-4 lab in Lyon, which some scientists find reassuring. And the facility has already carried out a test-run using a low-risk virus.But worries surround the Chinese lab, too. The SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times, notes Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Tim Trevan, founder of CHROME Biosafety and Biosecurity Consulting in Damascus, Maryland, says that an open culture is important to keeping BSL-4 labs safe, and he questions how easy this will be in China, where society emphasizes hierarchy. “Diversity of viewpoint, flat structures where everyone feels free to speak up and openness of information are important,” he says.Yuan says that he has worked to address this issue with staff. “We tell them the most important thing is that they report what they have or haven’t done,” he says. And the lab’s inter­national collaborations will increase openness. “Transparency is the basis of the lab,” he adds.The plan to expand into a network heightens such concerns. One BSL-4 lab in Harbin is already awaiting accreditation; the next two are expected to be in Beijing and Kunming, the latter focused on using monkey models to study disease.Lina says that China’s size justifies this scale, and that the opportunity to combine BSL-4 research with an abundance of research monkeys — Chinese researchers face less red tape than those in the West when it comes to research on primates — could be powerful. “If you want to test vaccines or antivirals, you need a non-human primate model,” says Lina.But Ebright is not convinced of the need for more than one BSL-4 lab in mainland China. He suspects that the expansion there is a reaction to the networks in the United States and Europe, which he says are also unwarranted. He adds that governments will assume that such excess capacity is for the potential development of bioweapons.“These facilities are inherently dual use,” he says. The prospect of ramping up opportunities to inject monkeys with pathogens also worries, rather than excites, him: “They can run, they can scratch, they can bite.”Trevan says China’s investment in a BSL-4 lab may, above all, be a way to prove to the world that the nation is competitive. “It is a big status symbol in biology,” he says, “whether it’s a need or not.”",0
"The new coronavirus pandemic would not have started if we didn’t farm and eat animals. the one thing they all have in common is that they started because of our exploitation of animals.COVID-19 would not exist if the world was vegan. Your personal choice to eat animals impacts every living being on this planet. Of course, many zoonotic diseases are unrelated to our exploitation of animals, and being vegan wouldn’t completely eliminate all of them, (Zika virus) being a prime example.",0
"COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, likely began in a “wet market” in Wuhan, China. Early research suggests the virus originated in bats and was transferred by a yet unknown intermediary animal to people. A possible animal that could’ve acted as a middleman is the pangolin (also called a scaly anteater), which is considered a delicacy in some Asian countries and illegally traded for its meat and scales.Wet markets are places where people can buy a variety of live animals for consumption. Many different species can be found stacked on top of one another in such environments, which are conducive to cross-species disease transfer. It is impossible to determine whether COVID-19 would have arisen without the existence of the wet markets or settings like it, but it is true that such markets supply the conditions for such diseases to arise and infect humans. Indeed, SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, resulted from a virus transferring from bats to civet cats and then humans. Discovered in 2003, SARS originated at a wet market similar to the one now suspected to be the origin of COVID-19.
Similarly, it is difficult to determine how many zoonotic diseases would arise in a world where humans didn’t eat meat. Yet even with the preventative measures in the American food system, like feeding livestock antibiotics and pathogen-reducing treatments like the chlorine washing of meat, the proximity to animals still allows for the possibility that diseases might be transferred through direct human-animal contact.Reducing human contact with animals, however, is likely the most effective way to lower the risk of transferring pandemic-causing viruses and bacteria to humans from animal populations.",1
"extensive research, our findings show consuming alcoholic beverages may help to reduce the risk of infection by the novel coronavirus. vodka for drinking, cleaning and sanitizing. alcohol can ward off the virus",0
"The real danger in contracting the COVID-19 virus is that it can get into your lungs and lead to pneumonia. According to the CDC, the alarm was raised about coronavirus after  patients died of ""cases of pneumonia of unknown cause ... reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.""Alcohol can be used to disinfect surfaces and kill COVID-19, and some distilleries are making hand sanitizer to address the shortage. But drinking it will not provide any protection against this virus. And it may even make you more susceptible.And there's more bad news about alcohol and viruses. According to a 2015 study published in the journal Alcohol Research, “excessive alcohol consumption"" is associated with ""adverse immune-related health effects such as susceptibility to pneumonia.”Let’s get this straight: Consuming alcohol does not kill the coronavirus and St. Luke’s Hospital of Kansas City never said it did.“It’s not authentic and it’s not true at all,” said Lindsey Stich, a spokeswoman for the Missouri-based hospital system. The hospital debunked the letter soon after it hit the Internet, but not all posts have been removed.",1
"Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no (COVID-19 caused) Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection",0
"University of Maryland Chief Quality Officer and Chief of Infectious Diseases Dr. Faheem Younus tweeted on March 16: “Wrong: Most young patients with coronavirus will be able to hold their breaths for much longer than 10 seconds. And many elderly without the virus won’t be able to do it.”On March 17, Dr. Thomas Nash, a New York Presbyterian Hospital internist, pulmonologist and infectious disease specialist, told Reuters the breath test was “just made up.”
Different posts mistakenly source the claim to an unnamed Stanford Hospital Board member, a Japanese doctor or Taiwanese experts. On March 13, Stanford University tweeted, “Misinformation about COVID-19 symptoms and treatment 0ly attributed to Stanford is circulating on social media and in email forwards. It is not from Stanford.”Stanford Health Care spokeswoman Lisa Kim told CNN on March 17 that the ""dangerous"" claim was not from Stanford Medicine and ""contains inaccurate information.""The March 13 post claimed the breath test checked for fibrosis caused by COVID-19. The post read, “By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late.”Fibrosis is defined as “the overgrowth, hardening, and/or scarring of various tissues” caused by “chronic inflammatory reactions induced by a variety of stimuli including persistent infections, autoimmune reactions, allergic responses, chemical insults, radiation, and tissue injury.”Dr. Robert Legare Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine called the post’s language ""extremely alarmist"" to CNN on March 17.Nash told Reuters that “fibrosis takes months if not years to develop.”Although COVID-19 can lead to pneumonia in some patients, which can eventually lead to fibrosis, Nash said this virus “is brand new and no one on the planet knows if it causes fibrosis.”’The post also claimed  the development of pneumonia was the second symptom of COVID-19, but according to the World Health Organization only patients with severe cases develop pneumonia.Along with fibrosis and pneumonia, the post misrepresents COVID-19 symptoms as feeling “like you’re drowning.”Atmar said COVID-19 patients likely wouldn’t experience that symptom, “That does not sound like any other respiratory virus people are infected with and many patients with coronavirus have not had nasal infection at all.""In addition to the breath test, Facebook posts suggest ineffective methods to protect against the virus such as drinking large amounts of water, gargling saltwater and exposure to heat and sun.A similar March 12 Facebook post with nearly 200 shares read, “Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water and other fluids will help wash it down ... the hydrochloric acid in your stomach will kill the germs. If you do not drink enough water regularly, the virus can enter the airways and into your lungs”.
Younas debunked the water method on Twitter, “Virus may gain entry via throat but it penetrates into the host cells. You can’t wash it away. Excessive water will make you run to the toilet.”PolitFact and Snopes both discredited the claim that “you should also gargle as a prevention” method. Both found that while gargling does ease throat discomfort there is no evidence that it kills the virus.The March 13 Facebook post also claimed that COVID-19 “hates the sun” and could be killed by just “26/27 degrees,” which is about 78 degrees Fahrenheit. PolitiFact debunked the claim that sun exposure kills the virus. The WHO warns that hot baths and warm climates do not prevent the spread of COVID-19.",1
"those who received the influenza vaccine are either more likely to test positive for the virus or to become sick with it. children who received the trivalent (three-strain) flu vaccine that year had a higher incidence rate of coronavirus. FYI if you got the flu shot you will likely test positive for corona, Remember ... they doubled the flu shot dose this year and even pushed it at the Golden Globes,"" the post said. ""... The quadrivalent FLU SHOT for the 2019-2020 season has a 'trivalent' strain of CORONAVIRUS **IN IT**.coronavirus outbreaks in China and Italy were due to increased vaccination. Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus,"" the study states",0
"Researchers update the flu shot annually to protect from strains of the influenza virus. Each shot protects from either three strains (trivalent) or four strains (quadrivalent) of influenza. The vaccine does not include any of the coronaviruses, a family of viruses that includes some that give people upper respiratory illnesses. It also is not meant to protect someone from them.The new strain of coronavirus that has turned into a global pandemic over the past four months can cause severe illness, with symptoms including fever, shortness of breath and coughing. More than 43,000 people had died of the virus worldwide as of Wednesday morning. Since coronavirus isn't in the flu shot, the shot won't give anyone symptoms of the coronavirus or cause them to test positive, said Dr. Christie Alexander, president of Florida Academy of Family Physicians and associate professor for the Florida State University College of Medicine.""If someone develops coronavirus symptoms, it may be because they came into contact with someone who had the virus a few weeks before they got their shot,"" she said. ""There's no cause and effect between the two."" Experts: Research doesn't back up a connection. Alexander said that despite the citations in Facebook posts, academic research has also not shown a connection between the flu shot and coronavirus. The Hong Kong study in question, she said, was a small study with limitations that shouldn't be extrapolated. The coronavirus mentioned in both studies is also not the new strain of coronavirus that has become a global pandemic.The phenomenon of ""viral interference"" referred to in the second study wouldn't make anyone more likely to contract coronavirus, said Dr. Akiko Iwasaki, professor of immunobiology and molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the Yale University School of Medicine.Viral interference, she said, is when a person already infected with one virus is resistant to infection with a second, because of how their immune system fights the first virus. The system isn't perfect, she said, and co-infection by multiple viruses can still occur. While it's true that people who get the flu shot are still susceptible to infection by other respiratory viruses like the common cold, they are not more susceptible than those who do not get the vaccine, she said.""I wouldn't think that the flu vaccine will make you more susceptible to these viruses,"" she said. ""It's just that they're so prevalent that you might pick up the infection with that more often than the flu virus, obviously for which you're protected."" While flu shots will not make a person more susceptible to the coronavirus, they also will not protect a person from it. There is no available vaccine for the coronavirus, although researchers are working on it.But the flu vaccine can help combating the coronavirus in one way, Iwasaki said. If everyone were to have the flu vaccine, fewer would catch the flu, theoretically freeing up hospital beds and resources for coronavirus patients, she said. ""In the population base, it makes sense for everyone to get the flu vaccine,"" she said. ""But with the individual, no, there is no interference between the flu vaccine and the coronavirus.""",1
"COVID-19 is the disease caused by the new coronavirus that emerged in China in December 2019.COVID-19 symptoms include cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, unexplained loss of taste or smell, diarrhea and headache. COVID-19 can be severe, and some cases have caused deathThe new coronavirus can be spread from person to person. It is diagnosed with a laboratory test.
There is no coronavirus vaccine yet. Prevention involves frequent hand-washing, coughing into the bend of your elbow, staying home when you are sick and wearing a cloth face covering if you can't practice social distancing. Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A newly identified type has caused a recent outbreak of respiratory illness now called COVID-19.How does the new coronavirus spread?
As of now, researchers know that the new coronavirus is spread through droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The droplets generally do not travel more than a few feet, and they fall to the ground (or onto surfaces) in a few seconds — this is why social and physical distancing is effective in preventing the spread.How did this new coronavirus spread to humans?COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, a city in China, in December 2019. Although health officials are still tracing the exact source of this new coronavirus, early hypotheses thought it may be linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, China. Some people who visited the market developed viral pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus. A study that came out on Jan. 25, 2020, notes that the individual with the first reported case became ill on Dec. 1, 2019, and had no link to the seafood market. Investigations are ongoing as to how this virus originated and spread. What is the incubation period for COVID-19?It appears that symptoms are showing up in people within 14 days of exposure to the virus.What are symptoms of COVID-19?COVID-19 symptoms include:Cough.Fever.Shortness of breath. Muscle aches. Sore throat.Unexplained loss of taste or smell.Diarrhea.Headache.In rare cases, COVID-19 can lead to severe respiratory problems, kidney failure or death.If you have a fever or any kind of respiratory difficulty such as coughing or shortness of breath, call your doctor or a health care provider and explain your symptoms over the phone before going to the doctor’s office, urgent care facility or emergency room. Here are suggestions if you feel sick and are concerned you might have COVID-19.If you have a medical emergency such as severe shortness of breath, call 911 and let them know about your symptoms.Learn more about COVID-19 symptoms.How is COVID-19 diagnosed?Diagnosis may be difficult with only a physical exam because mild cases of COVID-19 may appear similar to the flu or a bad cold. A laboratory test can confirm the diagnosis. Learn more about COVID-19 testing.How is COVID-19 treated?As of now, there is not a specific treatment for the virus. People who become sick from COVID-19 should be treated with supportive measures: those that relieve symptoms. For severe cases, there may be additional options for treatment, including research drugs and therapeutics.Does COVID-19 cause death?As of May 7, 2020, 264,111 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19. However, 1,250,579 people have recovered from the illness. This information comes from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases map developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.Is this coronavirus different from SARS?SARS stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome. In 2003, an outbreak of SARS started in China and spread to other countries before ending in 2004. The virus that causes COVID-19 is similar to the one that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak: both are types of coronaviruses. Much is still unknown, but COVID-19 seems to spread faster than the 2003 SARS and also may cause less severe illness.How do you protect yourself from this coronavirus?It’s crucial to practice good hygiene, respiratory etiquette and social and physical distancing. Read more about ways to protect yourself.About Coronaviruses. Coronaviruses are common in different animals. Rarely, an animal coronavirus can infect humans.There are many different kinds of coronaviruses. Some of them can cause colds or other mild respiratory (nose, throat, lung) illnesses.Other coronaviruses can cause more serious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
Coronaviruses are named for their appearance: Under the microscope, the viruses look like they are covered with pointed structures that surround them like a corona, or crown.",1
"According to a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can live in the air and on surfaces between several hours and several days. The study found that the virus is viable for up to 72 hours on plastics, 48 hours on stainless steel, 24 hours on cardboard, and 4 hours on copper. It is also detectable in the air for three hours.Volkin: According to this report, it sounds like the COVID-19 virus is potentially living on surfaces for days. How worried should we be about our risk of becoming infected simply by touching something an infected person was in contact with days ago?
Machamer: What's getting a lot of press and is presented out of context is that the virus can last on plastic for 72 hours—which sounds really scary. But what's more important is the amount of the virus that remains. It's less than 0.1% of the starting virus material. Infection is theoretically possible but unlikely at the levels remaining after a few days. People need to know this.While the New England Journal of Medicine study found that the COVID virus can be detected in the air for 3 hours, in nature, respiratory droplets sink to the ground faster than the aerosols produced in this study. The experimental aerosols used in labs are smaller than what comes out of a cough or sneeze, so they remain in the air at face-level longer than heavier particles would in nature.What is the best way I can protect myself, knowing that the virus that causes COVID-19 lives on surfaces?You are more likely to catch the infection through the air if you are next to someone infected than off of a surface. Cleaning surfaces with disinfectant or soap is very effective because once the oily surface coat of the virus is disabled, there is no way the virus can infect a host cell. However, there cannot be an overabundance of caution. Nothing like this has ever happened before.The CDC guidelines on how to protect yourself include:Clean and disinfect surfaces that many people come in contact with. These include tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Avoid touching high-contact surfaces in public.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds immediately when you return home from a public place such as the bank or grocery store.
When in a public space, put a distance of six feet between yourself and others.Most importantly, stay home if you are sick and contact your doctor.
There has been speculation that once the summer season arrives and the weather warms up, the virus won't survive, but we don't yet know if that is true. Does the weather or indoor temperature affect the survival of the COVID-19 virus on surfaces?There is no evidence one way or the other. The virus's viability in exposure to heat or cold has not been studied. But it does bear pointing out that the New England Journal of Medicine study was performed at about room temperature, 21-23 degrees Celsius.How does the virus that causes COVID-19 compare with other coronaviruses, and why are we seeing so many more cases?
SARS-CoV-2 behaves like a typical respiratory coronavirus in the basic mechanisms of infection and replication. But several mutations allow it to bind tighter to its host receptor and increase its transmissibility, which is thought to make it more infectious.The New England Journal of Medicine study suggests that the stability of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV1, the virus that caused the 2002-2003 SARS global outbreak. But, researchers believe people can carry high viral loads of the SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract without recognizing any symptoms, allowing them to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic.",1
"RUSH: Folks, this coronavirus thing, I want to try to put this in perspective for you. It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump. Now, I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus. (interruption) You think I’m wrong about this? You think I’m missing it by saying that’s… (interruption) Yeah, I’m dead right on this. The coronavirus is the common cold, folks.The Drive-By Media hype of this thing as a pandemic, as the Andromeda strain, as, “Oh, my God, if you get it, you’re dead.” Do you know what the — I think the survival rate is 98%. Ninety-eight percent of people get the coronavirus survive. It’s a respiratory system virus. It probably is a ChiCom laboratory experiment that is in the process of being weaponized. All superpower nations weaponize bioweapons. They experiment with them. The Russians, for example, have weaponized fentanyl. Now, fentanyl is also not what it is represented to be.If you watch cop shows, then you probably… Stick with me on this. If you watch cop shows, you probably believe that just the dust from a package of fentanyl can kill you if you’re in the same room with it. Not true. Not true. Even the cheap kind of fentanyl coming from China that’s used to spike heroin… They use fentanyl ’cause it’s cheap. It gives a quick hit, doesn’t last very long, which is really cool if you’re trying to addict people.But it doesn’t kill people the way it’s projected on TV. It can if you OD on it. But inhaling a little fentanyl dust is not going to cause you to lose consciousness and stop breathing as they depict on cop shows. It’s dangerous. Don’t misunderstand. But it isn’t the way it’s portrayed in popular criminal TV shows, cop shows, and so forth and so on. The coronavirus is the same. It’s really being hyped as a deadly Andromeda Strain or Ebola pandemic that, “Oh, my God, is going to wipe out the nation. It’s going to wipe out the population of the world.”The stock market’s down like 900 points right now. The survival rate of this is 98%! You have to read very deeply to find that number, that 2% of the people get the coronavirus die. That’s less than the flu, folks. That is a far lower death statistic than any form of influenza, which is an annual thing that everybody gets shots for. There’s nothing unusual about the coronavirus. In fact, coronavirus is not something new. There are all kinds of viruses that have that name. Now, do not misunderstand. I’m not trying to get you to let your guard down.Nobody wants to get any of this stuff. I mean, you never… I hate getting the common cold. You don’t want to get the flu. It’s miserable. But we’re not talking about something here that’s gonna wipe out your town or your city if it finds its way there. This is a classic illustration of how media coverage works. Even if this media coverage isn’t stacked, even if this is just the way media normally does things, this is a hyped, panic-filled version. It’s exactly how the media deals with these things to create audience, readership, interest, clicks, what have you.It originated in China in a little — well, not a little town. It’s a town that is 11 million people, Wuhan, China. One of the reasons they’re able to hype this is that the doctor what warned everybody about it came down with it and died. So if a doctor got it, “Oh, my God, Rush! A doctor got it? You can’t possibly be right if a doctor can’t protect himself.” He didn’t know what he was dealing with. He discovered it back in December. I’m telling you, the ChiComs are trying to weaponize this thing. Here’s the story on Russians and fentanyl.Fentanyl is a very, very powerful opiate — and for those of you that haven’t had any experience with opiates, the people that get addicted to ’em take them and they get very euphoric. They kill pain. They do wonderful things. But they make you very, very euphoric. They act like speed. Other people take ’em, and they hate ’em. It makes ’em vomit, throw up, feel nauseous. It doesn’t do anything for ’em. They’re never gonna get addicted.So in Moscow the Chechens, way back… I’m gonna go back now — what is it — maybe 10 years or longer. A bunch of Chechen rebels took over an opera house and had a bunch of Russian hostages in there and made all kinds of threats — and Putin, unbeknownst to anybody, had weaponized fentanyl. He’d turned it into a gas, an invisible gas. He just put it in the ventilation system of this opera house or whatever it was (I’m giving you the sketchy, short version of this) and everybody in there fell asleep and died. You know, in a drug overdose, you stop breathing.That’s what… It slows down your respiratory system so much that you stop breathing. That’s what an OD is, and everybody in that place, including the Chechens — Pfft! — had no idea what happened to ’em. It’s not violent. You just fall asleep for unknown reasons at the amounts that Putin weaponized and put in there. If you take a normal dose of fentanyl that you get from a doctor in a hospital, it’s not gonna kill you, obviously. But the amount they weaponized — and up to this time, nobody had ever weaponized fentanyl.Nobody had ever made it into an invisible, odorless, colorless gas, until it was discovered that the Russians had done it. Well, every nation is working on things like this, and the ChiComs obviously in their lab are doing something here with the coronavirus — and it got out. Some people believe it got out on purpose, that the ChiComs have a whole lot of problems based on an economy that cannot provide for the number of people they have. So losing a few people here or there is not so bad for the Chinese government.There could be anything to explain this.But the way it’s being used… I believe the way it’s being weaponized is by virtue of the media, and I think that it is an effort to bring down Trump, and one of the ways it’s being used to do this is to scare the investors, to scare people in business. It’s to scare people into not buying Treasury bills at auctions. It’s to scare people into leaving, cashing out of the stock market — and sure enough, as the show began today, the stock market — the Dow Jones Industrial Average — was down about 900 points, supposedly because of the latest news about the spread of the coronavirus.And if you go deeper into China, you will see that all of the high-tech Silicon Valley firms are said to be terribly exposed. “They could be suffering a disastrous year. Why, you may not be able to buy a new iPhone of any model this whole year! Do you know that? Because the coronavirus is so bad that the factories may never open — and if they do, they may not be anywhere near full capacity.” So Apple may not be able to release any new product. You think that’s not gonna panic investors? It most certainly is.So Apple is trying to do what they can to suggest that these rumors are not true. They got new products coming this year. But the tech media hates Apple. They love anti-Apple stories. They love anything that will let them report that Apple’s on its last legs. Of course, that’s not true. Warren Buffett came out today and said, “Apple is the best run company ever.” He’s a big stockholder. So people will say he’s biased about it. But the bias you have to pay attention to is how much money he invested. He got $36 billion in Apple stock that Berkshire Hathaway has.They sold $800 million of Apple stock last week, and everybody said, “Oh, my God, he’s getting out!” No, he’s not. He’s got $36 billion. He sold $800 million. No big deal. He wanted to allocate it somewhere else. So this is… I think the coronavirus is an effort to get Trump. It’s not gonna work. It’s one of the latest in a long line of efforts that the Drive-By Media’s making to somehow say that Trump and capitalism are destroying America and destroying the world. Just keep in mind where the coronavirus came from.It came from a country that Bernie Sanders wants to turn the United States into a mirror image of: Communist China. That’s where it came from. It didn’t come from an American lab. It didn’t escape from an American research lab. It hasn’t been spread by Americans. It starts out in a communist country. Its tentacles spread all across the world in numbers that are not big and not huge, but they’re being reported as just the opposite. Just trying to keep it all in perspective.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT. RUSH: Here’s Neil in Orlando. Great to have you on the program, sir. Hello.CALLER: Hello, Rush. Man, I’m blessed to have the chance to talk to you. I cannot believe it. So you were talking about the coronavirus a little bit a while ago, and what’s the one thing that disappeared when the coronavirus came out?RUSH: Well, let me see. What one thing? Just hang on. What disappeared? What disappeared? What disappeared? Oh, the protests in Hong Kong went away.CALLER: Yes. That’s it.RUSH: That’s a big. CALLER: Yup.RUSH: (whispering) Talent on loan from God.CALLER: That sure is.RUSH: That’s probably the big one, the protests in Hong Kong.CALLER: That’s my take from it. I don’t know. I’ve got a friend over there that sends me stuff. But there’s a lot… We don’t want to start any conspiracy theories, but this will be my only time I ever get through to you ’cause I’ve been calling since ’92. But I just want to say about your talent on loan from God: Just in the time, I was on hold listening to you, and it got me to the point where I just wanted to say that Trump got no notice about Russian meddling like Sanders did. So why not? I wonder about that. When Carter was president, my first home buying — I was a first-time home buyer — the rate was 13.33%. I’ll never forget it, and that was a first-time homeowner!RUSH: I know. I know.CALLER: That was a deal!RUSH: I know. I know.CALLER: That was a deal at 13.33%!RUSH: I bought my first shack, you know, at that time in Overland Park, Kansas. I had no business buying it. But everybody said, “You gotta buy! Don’t rent. You’re throwing money away if you rent.”CALLER: Mmm-hmm.RUSH: So, you know, my one time I became a conformist, it got me. I didn’t want to live in this shack! I never wanted to move into this shack. But it’s what I bought, so I had to move into the thing.CALLER: And one more .RUSH: I didn’t even want people to take me home. I didn’t want people to see this shack that I lived in. One day, we’re playing football — the Chiefs front office, the Royals front office — after the baseball season. Thursday afternoon flag football. George Brett’s playing and he offered to take me home. I said (chuckles), “No, George, I’m fine.” I didn’t want Brett to see where the shack was. So, yeah, 13% interest rates during Carter, and it was bad. Carter actually coined the term “malaise” to describe his own administration and its effect on the American economy!We had “the misery index” and all of that.But look, back to the coronavirus for just a second. That is true that the Hong Kong protests strangely subsided as the news of the coronavirus expanded — and I’ll tell you, it is a way… If you are a totalitarian government and you need to control your population, one of the best ways of doing it is unleashing something they think is a deadly disease and then you, as the dictator, have the “safety solutions.” You have the ability to round people up from their homes and take ’em to so-called health camps.Be very leery of this, folks.It probably is not what the media’s leading you to believe it is.",0
"At an emergency meeting in Beijing held last Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke about the need to contain the coronavirus and set up a system to prevent similar epidemics in the future.A national system to control biosecurity risks must be put in place “to protect the people’s health,” Xi said, because lab safety is a “national security” issue.Xi didn’t actually admit that the coronavirus now devastating large swaths of China had escaped from one of the country’s bioresearch labs. But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is exactly what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive titled: “Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.”Read that again. It sure sounds like China has a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong, doesn’t it? And just how many “microbiology labs” are there in China that handle “advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus”?It turns out that in all of China, there is only one. And this one is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be … the epicenter of the epidemic.That’s right. China’s only Level 4 microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, called the National Biosafety Laboratory, is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.What’s more, the People’s Liberation Army’s top expert in biological warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.According to the PLA Daily, Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax. This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.Does that suggest to you that the novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, may have escaped from that very lab, and that Chen’s job is to try to put the genie back in the bottle, as it were? It does to me.Add to this China’s history of similar incidents. Even the deadly SARS virus has escaped — twice — from the Beijing lab where it was (and probably is) being used in experiments. Both “man-made” epidemics were quickly contained, but neither would have happened at all if proper safety precautions had been taken.
And then there is this little-known fact: Some Chinese researchers are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them.You heard me right.Instead of properly disposing of infected animals by cremation, as the law requires, they sell them on the side to make a little extra cash. Or, in some cases, a lot of extra cash. One Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound up in someone’s stomach.Also fueling suspicions about SARS-CoV-2’s origins is the series of increasingly lame excuses offered by the Chinese authorities as people began to sicken and die.They first blamed a seafood market not far from the Institute of Virology, even though the first documented cases of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) involved people who had never set foot there. Then they pointed to snakes, bats and even a cute little scaly anteater called a pangolin as the source of the virus.
I don’t buy any of this. It turns out that snakes don’t carry coronaviruses and that bats aren’t sold at a seafood market. Neither, for that matter, are pangolins, an endangered species valued for their scales as much as for their meat.The evidence points to SARS-CoV-2 research being carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virus may have been carried out of the lab by an infected worker or crossed over into humans when they unknowingly dined on a lab animal. Whatever the vector, Beijing authorities are now clearly scrambling to correct the serious problems with the way their labs handle deadly pathogens.China has unleashed a plague on its own people. It’s too early to say how many in China and other countries will ultimately die for the failures of their country’s state-run microbiology labs, but the human cost will be high.But not to worry. Xi has assured us that he is controlling biosecurity risks “to protect the people’s health.” PLA bioweapons experts are in charge.I doubt the Chinese people will find that very reassuring. Neither should we.Steven W. Mosher is the president of the Population Research Institute and the author of “Bully of Asia: Why China’s ‘Dream’ Is the New Threat to World Order.”",0
"With the Covid-19 pandemic, there are so many new things we need to grow accustomed to. We’re physically avoiding many of the people and places we love, and too many are now being burdened by the sudden economic crisis that has arisen alongside the pandemic.But there are also a lot of new, and confusing, terms we’re hearing about.It’s okay if you’re unsure of the difference between a respirator and a ventilator, or the distinction between isolation and quarantine. We hope this glossary of pandemic terms will help.Virus and outbreak terms. SARS-CoV-2 — The formal, scientific name of the virus that’s causing this pandemic. (It’s short for “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.”)
Covid-19 — The disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. If you’re sick, you have Covid-19. You were infected by SARS-CoV-2. (If you’re still confused, think about how the HIV virus causes AIDS.)Coronavirus — This is a family of viruses that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to (technically they are known as betacoronaviruses, but you can just say coronavirus). The 2003 SARS outbreak was a coronavirus, as was MERS in 2012. They are named coronaviruses because of their shape. When viewed through a microscope, the individual virus looks like a sphere surrounded by a spiky crown (or corona).Endemic — A disease that regularly infects humans, like the flu, strep throat, or any common illness. There are four coronavirus strains that commonly infect humans, usually manifesting as colds. It’s possible that SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, too.Pandemic — A worldwide spread of a new disease. Most famous, perhaps, is the 1918 flu pandemic that is believed to have infected one in three people on the planet. Pandemic diseases can become endemic. The World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.Epidemic — A disease that’s spreading over a wide area. An epidemic is a less severe designation than a pandemic, but there is an overlap between the two terms. And yes, it’s a bit confusing: “While a pandemic may be characterized as a type of epidemic, you would not say that an epidemic is a type of pandemic,” Merriam-Webster explains. The 2015-2016 spread of the Zika virus through South and Central America and the Caribbean was an epidemic.Herd immunity — Herd immunity occurs when enough people become immune to a disease — either through exposure or via a vaccine — that the spread of the disease begins to slow, or stop, within a population. Right now, immunity to Covid-19 is not well understood. In time, researchers will be able to test the blood of people who have recovered from Covid-19 in the weeks and months following their infection and see if they still are immune. And those studies will teach us about whether we, collectively, can develop herd immunity to Covid-19.Zoonotic disease — A illness that can pass between animals and humans. Covid-19 is a zoonotic disease. It’s believed SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats. HIV, Ebola, Zika virus, and even measles (which jumped from cows to humans a very long time ago) are all believed to have originated in animals, in some form, before spreading to humans.R0 — Pronounced r-nought, R0 is the statistic that describes how contagious a disease is. “The figure refers to how many other people one sick person is likely to infect on average in a group that’s susceptible to the disease (meaning they don’t already have immunity from a vaccine or from fighting off the disease before),” Vox’s Julia Belluz explains. An R0 of 2, for example, means each infected person is expected to spread the virus to two others. The exact R0 for Covid-19 is still being determined, but it’s currently believed to be between 2 and 2.5.Confirmed cases — The number of Covid-19 cases that have been confirmed by diagnostic testing. Due to a shortage of tests, the actual number of cases that exist is likely much higher.Case fatality rate (CFR) — The death rate. This figure explains what percentage of Covid-19 cases are fatal. It varies by country and age group, and the final figure will depend on figuring out the true number of cases (which is hard to estimate without widespread testing).Modes of transmission — How a virus spreads from one person to another. Scientists are still working out how exactly this virus spreads. The main mode of transmission appears to be via droplets. These are bits of virus-laden fluid a person spews out when they cough or sneeze. Researchers are still working out the conditions under which the virus can be airborne, meaning how long viral particles can linger in the air under some environmental conditions. It’s also possible that the virus can spread via the fecal-oral route, meaning the virus can be transmitted through feces, which can then contaminate water or food if good hygiene is lacking.Public health measures. Social distancing — A slew of tactics meant to keep people from congregating, with the goal of keeping people 6 feet apart from one another. Six feet of distance helps keep droplets from an infected person’s nose or mouth from hitting another person. These tactics include canceling schools, public events, closing down restaurants, and banning events of 10 or more people.Quarantine — Restricting the movement of, or isolating, people who might have been exposed to an infection but who aren’t yet sick. Usually, quarantine restricts a person’s movement to their home.Isolation — Separating people with confirmed or probable infections from other healthy people, so that they can get better without infecting anyone else. One member of a household could be in isolation (perhaps in a designated room that others do not enter), while the other members of the household are in quarantine (free to move around the home but not enter the isolation area).Lockdown — “The term ‘lock-down’ isn’t a technical term used by public health officials or lawyers,” Lindsay Wiley, a health law professor at the Washington College of Law, explained in an email. “It could be used to refer to anything from mandatory geographic quarantine (which would probably be unconstitutional under most scenarios in the US), to non-mandatory recommendations to shelter in place (which are totally legal and can be issued by health officials at the federal, state, or local level), to anything in between (e.g. ordering certain events or types of businesses to close, which is generally constitutional if deemed necessary to stop the spread of disease based on available evidence).”Cordon sanitaire — The restriction of movement in and out of a region or city. China imposed one on the city of Wuhan during the early days of the outbreak.Shelter in place — An order requesting people stay at home, except for trips to the grocery store, pharmacies, and other essential errands. Each state or city might define “shelter in place” slightly differently. (Like “lockdown,” this term can refer to a variety of guidelines.) Each local government could also enforce these orders differently — from just asking citizens to do it on a volunteer basis to enforcing orders with police citations. The important thing is to check with your local authority for details on what is allowed, and what is not, when the local government tells you to shelter in place. Some cities, like Washington, DC, are not using this term but are instead telling people to “stay home.” It’s effectively the same thing.Medical equipment and pharmaceuticals
Ventilator — A machine that moves air in and out of the lungs in the case that a patient cannot, or is having trouble breathing on their own.PPE — Personal protective equipment, such as masks, gloves, face shields, and other gear that keeps health care workers from catching an infection.
Respirator — A face mask that seals around the mouth and filters out particles from the air before they are breathed in. An N95 respirator, for example, filters out “95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles,” the Food and Drug Administration explains. Doctors, nurses, and hospital workers are facing shortages of this essential protective facewear.Surgical mask or face mask — These are loose-fitting masks that don’t filter out as many particles as a respirator. But they do stop a wearer from spreading droplets of contagion when they sneeze or cough. They’re also helpful in preventing a wearer from touching their face with dirty hands.Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine — Antimalarial drugs hyped by President Trump (despite weak evidence) as being potentially useful in treating Covid-19. Clinical trials of these drugs are underway, but early evidence is still not clear they prove useful. These aren’t the only drugs currently being tested to treat Covid-19: Doctors are also testing antiviral medication and some HIV drugs. These drugs are also used to treat arthritis and lupus, as they also have anti-inflammatory properties.Fever — Generally, a fever is when the body temperature exceeds 100.4°F, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But there is some variability here. Human bodies tend to be coldest when we wake up. So a 100.4-degree fever in the morning might grow a little hotter throughout the day. Some people also run a little hotter or colder than others. The CDC advises “fever may be considered to be present if a person has not had a temperature measurement but feels warm to the touch, or gives a history of feeling feverish.”Pneumonia — When the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli, the structures where gases from the atmosphere are exchanged with the blood) become inflamed and fill up with fluid. It’s a possible symptom of Covid-19.Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) — A technology used for Covid-19 diagnostic testing. It looks for the virus’s genetic signature.Serological tests — A diagnostic test that looks for antibodies (a blood protein built to help fight off a specific virus or pathogen), could tell if someone has ever been infected with Covid-19, and could suggest they are possibly immune. These tests are still being developed for Covid-19.Vaccine — A formulation to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies for a pathogen in the hope of providing immunity to that pathogen. Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are being tested, but it could be a year or more before they are approved. A safe and effective vaccine can stop this pandemic in its tracks.
Therapeutics — Drugs that lessen the severity of disease symptoms. The World Health Organization is currently facilitating a multinational clinical trial, testing medicines — and combinations of medicines — to treat Covid-19. Therapeutics won’t necessarily stop the outbreak, though. They may keep people from getting severely sick or dying. Even with therapeutics, the virus could still spread, infecting millions.",1
"With the United States facing a serious coronavirus outbreak, it’s natural to wonder whether you’ll get the respiratory illness and what you can do about it. Hundreds of thousands of cases and thousands of deaths have been reported in the US. But due to a lack of widespread testing, it’s likely the outbreak is even bigger.As evidence of widespread unreported cases, Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, pointed on Twitter to the CDC’s National Influenza Surveillance Report, which regularly tracks symptoms similar to those of Covid-19. He noted that symptoms such as fever, coughs, and sore throats have been trending up, while confirmed flu cases are going down. (Common symptoms of the flu and Covid-19 are similar.)As the coronavirus spreads, it’s become a nationwide crisis that’s beginning to severely strain our health care system. Older adults and chronically ill are particularly susceptible to severe Covid-19 illness, and tens or hundreds of thousands of them could require hospitalization in the coming weeks and months. So we need to take collective measures now to protect ourselves and others. Here’s what you need to know:1) How do I get Covid-19?There are a lot of acronyms floating around, so first, just know that the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the coronavirus) causes the disease Covid-19. The virus is most commonly spread by close contact with infected people who are within 6 feet of each other. When they cough or sneeze, they send droplets into the air, where they can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby, or possibly get inhaled into the lungs. Droplets containing the virus can also land on surfaces and objects where the virus can survive for some time.According to a preprint paper (a study that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed) from researchers at the National Institutes of Health, Princeton, and UCLA who studied the novel coronavirus in a lab, it can survive for up to 24 hours on cardboard and for up to two or three days on plastic and stainless steel. (Another study suggests it can stay infectious for up to nine days.)The danger of infection here is touching one of these surfaces and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. The CDC, however, says that “this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.”Some diseases, like measles, can also be transmitted through aerosols, meaning that when someone coughs, tiny droplets filled with virus linger in the air, sometimes for hours, where others can breathe them in. Currently, there’s limited evidence of the coronavirus being transmitted this way, but it’s worth noting. One preprint found the virus in aerosol form in hospitals in Wuhan, and others agree that there is a higher risk of doctors and nurses being infected through aerosols. There’s also growing evidence of fecal-oral transmission, meaning you can ingest the virus shed in feces through inadequate hand-washing or contaminated food and water.The good news is that transmission can be prevented. Good personal hygiene and social distancing can be very effective. “I’m not one of those people who normally goes crazy about hand-washing,” says Megan Murray, an infectious disease specialist and professor of global health at the Harvard School of Public Health. “Now I really am, because that will help reduce [the] virus on your hands.”Washing your hands frequently and carefully for at least 20 seconds is better than using hand sanitizer because it actually destroys the chemical structure of the virus. Any old soap will break the virus’s outer coating, and you don’t need special antibacterial soap. If soap and water aren’t available, use hand sanitizer with 60 percent alcohol (no, this doesn’t include Tito’s vodka).New research suggests that people may be most infectious early in the disease (and even before symptoms start), meaning that as soon as you start to feel ill, it’s important to self-isolate. You don’t need to be coughing to be contagious; the linked preprint suggests that somewhere between 48 and 66 percent of 91 people in a Singapore cluster were infected by someone without symptoms.This makes taking precautions now — like canceling your travel plans and social gatherings— even more important. The effectiveness of widespread travel bans, especially when community transmission is already occurring, is being hotly debated, but in general, minimizing social contact is the best method of prevention.Avoid handshakes or hugs with people who’ve been out and about, and whenever possible, stay at least 6 feet away from others. This includes minimizing or avoiding play dates, sleepovers, shared meals, going out to eat, and visits to friends’ and family members’ homes.
Also important to know is that according to one study from China, around 25 percent of all cases may originate in people who have no symptoms — another reason social distancing measures are so important.
2) Oops, I think I touched my face. What are the symptoms of Covid-19?The most common symptoms of Covid-19 are a fever, seen in almost 90 percent of patients, as well as a dry cough and shortness of breath. A study of 71 patients in China also suggests that a significant portion of coronavirus patients experience diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting, sometimes before respiratory symptoms begin. The World Health Organization (WHO) says these symptoms typically come on gradually.Around 80 percent of Covid-19 cases are reportedly “mild,” but as James Hamblin of the Atlantic noted, that word can be misleading:As the World Health Organization adviser Bruce Aylward clarified last week, a “mild” case of COVID-19 is not equivalent to a mild cold. Expect it to be much worse: fever and coughing, sometimes pneumonia—anything short of requiring oxygen. “Severe” cases require supplemental oxygen, sometimes via a breathing tube and a ventilator. “Critical” cases involve “respiratory failure or multi-organ failure.”The incubation period before symptoms appear ranges from one to 14 days, but the median is 5.1 days. If you’ve been around someone who has a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 or displays its symptoms, the most responsible thing to do is to self-quarantine for two weeks.But I’m young and healthy. Do I really need to worry about getting sick or spreading the virus to others?
Yes, you do.The reason is that social distancing works best if everyone — young and old, healthy and infirm — practices it. No one has immunity, and everyone can get sick and spread the virus to others.“The more young and healthy people are sick at the same time, the more old people will be sick, and the more pressure there will be on the health care system,” Emily Landon, an infectious disease specialist and hospital epidemiologist at the University of Chicago Medical Center, told Vox’s Eliza Barclay and Dylan Scott.Without protective measures, one person on average infects 2.5 others, and cases will spread exponentially. That means hospitals and medical staff will quickly become overwhelmed. At least 5 percent of Covid-19 patients may need intensive care, and many require hospitalization for weeks.Even if you’re not at a statistically higher risk of dying from Covid-19, it’s important to “flatten the curve” and adopt social distancing measures immediately to prevent the most deaths.Also, just being young and healthy is not a guarantee of mild illness. The epicenter of New Jersey’s outbreak of Covid-19, Holy Name Medical Center, had 11 confirmed Covid-19 cases on March 14, six of which were in the ICU, with ages ranging from 28 to 48.
4) I have a fever (or a dry cough). What should I do?
If you have one or more symptoms of the new coronavirus, call your doctor. If you are older or have underlying medical conditions, it’s even more important to call your doctor, even if you have only mild symptoms, according to the CDC. Before you go to your doctor’s office, Murray says you should call ahead so that medical staff can wear the appropriate protective gear and be ready to help take care of you without exposing others. Many health care facilities are requesting that you wear a mask if you have symptoms and are going in for testing.Your doctor will determine whether you should be tested; if a test is ordered, you can expect a nasopharyngeal swab, where a tiny Q-tip is put up your nose a few inches — not a fun procedure, but it doesn’t hurt. It’s then sent to a lab and put through a process called a polymerase chain reaction, which detects specific genetic material within the virus. How long it takes to get results back varies, but in the US, it’s currently taking a few days. Covid-19 testing is free for patients, regardless of whether they have insurance. Treatment fees and other costs are possible, though many insurers have waived cost-sharing for treatment.Many people who know they’ve been exposed are currently having difficulty actually getting tested. Flynn says her colleague developed similar symptoms after sharing a cab with CPAC participants, a conference in DC where multiple people fell sick from Covid-19.
That’s true even in Covid-19 hot spots. Helen Teixeria, a resident of Redmond, a suburb of Seattle, one of the nation’s outbreak epicenters, says she woke up last week with a tight chest, fever, and a dry cough.First, she called the King County hotline and was told to call her primary care provider. Her doctor told her to go to the emergency room, where the hospital didn’t follow standard isolation protocol and medical staff did not wear basic protective gear. Teixeria said she was unable to get a Covid-19 test because they were being tightly rationed for high-risk and hospitalized patients. Nor was she allowed to get a two-view chest X-ray “so that I didn’t contaminate the X-ray room,” she says. A sympathetic nurse eventually slipped her off-the-record information on a private clinic where she might be able to get a Covid-19 test next week.I’m definitely sick and still waiting to be tested. What else should I do?
After you call your doctor, stay home, says Tom Frieden, former director of the CDC. It sounds like overly simple advice, but it’s the best thing you can do. Next, you should self-isolate, including staying away from anyone you live with.If you’re not in one of the CDC’s high-risk categories, trying to see your doctor may actually expose you further. “The single place you’re most likely to encounter people with coronavirus is the hospital, so that’s the last place you want to be if you’re afraid of getting infected,” Murray says. And if, in your quest to get tested, you go to multiple health care centers, you’ll be exposing health care workers in each location.If you think you might have Covid-19 — and frankly, even if you don’t, so that you avoid possibly spreading it before you have symptoms — avoid all public areas. This means don’t go to school or work, and try to avoid taking public transportation, including ride-hailing services like Uber, Lyfts, and taxis.
If you don’t have adequate supplies at home, consider asking friends or family to make a delivery to your door rather than going out yourself. Don’t let friends come visit while you’re recuperating; instead, stay connected by phone or online.What’s the best way to take care of myself at home?
“Self-care [for coronavirus] is very similar to other upper respiratory infections,” says Elisa Choi, an infectious disease and internal medicine specialist in the Boston area. Over-the-counter medications, like cough suppressants, can help minimize coughing episodes, and expectorants can help you cough stuff up.
Pain relievers and fever reducers like acetaminophen (brand name Tylenol) can help treat muscle aches and reduce fevers. Out of an abundance of caution, WHO on March 18 began recommending that people with Covid-19 symptoms avoid taking ibuprofen, but then reversed course. Some scientists say there’s not much data to back this.“There are multiple assumptions that are made with that hypothesis that can’t be made without being tested,” Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at Columbia University’s Center for Infection and Immunity, told Vox. “To my knowledge there’s no evidence that ibuprofen makes [Covid-19] worse.”
Choi also urges using common sense to manage symptoms. “If you’re feeling congestion, you can try taking a hot shower or steam,” she says. “Sleep and water are always good advice.” The CDC says that “drinking enough water every day is generally good for your overall health.”
Choi and other medical professionals warn against circulating misinformation about supposed home remedies, such as what’s happening with an email erroneously claiming to be from Stanford. These “remedies” include holding your breath without coughing and keeping your mouth moist. Many of these ideas are unproven, and some can be dangerous. (For example, you can overdose on zinc.)“This is really a time to stick with the facts,” Choi says. “Stay away from things that are being promoted for sale without a known background.” She recommends always checking with your doctor if you have questions about the veracity of a particular source. The CDC and WHO, as well as your local and state public health departments, are good sources of updated, verified information.
7) If I’m sick, how do I protect the people I live with?
Choi says that suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients should stay in their own room and (ideally) not share a bathroom.
“They should try to stay as far away as possible from anyone else in the household, and at least 6 feet,” she added. If you do share a bathroom, avoid being in the room at the same time as anyone else. The WHO found that most of the transmission in China was between family members.
If the sick person feels up to it, ideally they should be the one to disinfect the bathroom after they use it. If your living situation doesn’t allow you to isolate yourself from others in your home, tell your doctor and/or health department.
The CDC has a complete guide to disinfecting commonly touched surfaces like “counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables,” and it recommends doing so every day. You can use one of the approved products or make your own, like adding four teaspoons of bleach to a quart of water. The CDC also recommends wearing gloves when touching possibly infected items, like used clothing or bedding, as well as when disinfecting commonly used surfaces. When you’ve finished, throw the gloves directly in the garbage — and then wash your hands.Choi suggests washing your hands frequently to protect others in your household, and covering your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze with a tissue that you throw directly into the garbage. If you’re feeling ill, don’t share cups, utensils, dish or bath towels, toothpaste, bedding — or anything else — with anyone. The coronavirus can stick around on surfaces for several days.8) When should I seek additional medical care?Choi recommends closely monitoring your symptoms. “It’s less about a number and more about the progression,” she says. Generally, a low-grade fever is considered less than 100.4, but older people are generally less likely to mount a fever response. The main thing to watch for is symptoms getting worse. For example, if you initially have a mild cough but start to have prolonged bouts, or if coughing becomes painful, she recommends calling your doctor again.The CDC says that you should seek medical attention immediately if you have difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, persistent pain or chest pressure, an onset of confusion or the inability to stay awake, and bluish lips or face. If you do decide to go to the hospital, make sure to call ahead so the hospital can prepare to admit you without exposing others. If you already have a mask at home, this would be a good time to wear it. The CDC has recommended cloth masks for everyone but infants when in certain public settings. But medical masks should be reserved for health workers and sick people; there is a severe shortage.
Know that if you do go to the hospital, there is currently no treatment for Covid-19. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, is in clinical trials, but right now, doctors are limited to providing supportive care such as supplemental oxygen.9) How long do I have to stay isolated?While there’s still a lot we don’t know, Murray says that you should self-isolate for at least 14 days after your initial symptoms. (There have been a few reports of patients shedding viruses for up to 28 days, but those appear to be outliers.) This means avoiding contact with everyone. (Read Vox’s guide to self-isolation here.)For her part, Choi recommends minimizing all contact until your doctor or a public health department tells you that you are no longer contagious.
10) I already have cabin fever. My kids are bouncing off the walls. And I’m so anxious I can’t sleep. Help!
“Measures for pandemic control can be stressful,” Choi says, especially for people who may have challenges with being isolated. This feeling may get worse over the next few weeks, as current social-distancing measures are likely to be extended. Such measures can also cause financial hardship and stress for people who can’t work from home or won’t get paid if they don’t go to work.Many people are experiencing cognitive dissonance about the ongoing normality of their daily lives, or, conversely, experiencing very rapid change. Be kind to yourself and others if you are struggling. Whether you’re afraid of getting sick or reacting to uncertainty, financial hardship, or a lack of information, anxiety is a natural response and you are not alone.If you have preexisting mental health conditions, be aware that this may trigger new or worsening symptoms. (The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration has a 24/7 Disaster Distress Helpline, reachable at 1-800-985-5990. It also has an app with additional resources.)No matter how stressed you feel, it’s crucial not to scapegoat others. This virus is not transmitted by or infecting any particular group. “I’ve experienced anti-Asian racism myself,” says Choi, and “it’s disrespectful, hateful, and not grounded in facts.”Know that the situation is not hopeless; collectively changing behavior can go a long way toward controlling the spread of this disease. China has now closed all of its temporary hospitals as its case numbers continue to decline. But the social and economic repercussions of this pandemic may continue for months, so prepare yourself mentally for a long haul.
Do the small things that are in your control, like giving yourself a break from the news — put down Twitter — and maintaining normal routines as much as possible. If you’re at home with family or roommates, find ways to give each other space. Be creative about finding ways to exercise; YouTube videos are a great resource, if you can’t get outside. Talk to your loved ones about what you and they need to stay happy and healthy.
11) Can I get reinfected with Covid-19? And is it better to get sick to build herd immunity?
Japan and China have both reported multiple cases of people testing positive after initially recovering. It’s unclear if these were relapses or new infections. In four medical professionals in Wuhan, a test detected the virus’s genetic material up to 13 days after they stopped having symptoms, but finding genetic material doesn’t necessarily mean you can still infect others.Once you’ve gotten sick, you might have some immunity, says Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine of the Baylor College of Medicine, but really, the jury’s still out. “We don’t know, it depends on your antibody response,” he says. (A new, encouraging preprint showed that in some monkeys, reinfection of Covid-19 does not occur.)Hotez suggests that recovered patients do seem to produce antibodies. He pointed to a new paper on the possibility of using blood from recovered patients as a treatment, or even a preventive measure for first responders.Still, recovered patients may also experience lasting effects; doctors in Hong Kong said that some recovered patients had a 20 to 30 percent drop in lung capacity. Another alarming preprint suggests some patients may have permanent kidney damage.What about building herd immunity?The UK government early on announced a strategy of allowing the virus to spread to build herd immunity, although it has since walked it back and is recommending self-isolation. For herd immunity to control Covid-19, more than 60 percent of the population will need to get the disease. The logic is that extreme lockdowns now won’t stop the virus from returning in the future, when those measures are loosened.The problem is that many people may succumb to the disease in the meantime, and that by not attempting to control the spread, hospitals and medical systems will be overwhelmed. Achieving herd immunity in the UK would require more than 47 million Britons to be infected, which could mean around hundreds of thousands would die. Immunity might also not last long enough to help, as with the flu, where new strains emerge each year. Relying on herd immunity also conflicts with WHO policy. Anthony Costello, a pediatrician and former WHO director, tweeted, “Is it ethical to adopt a policy that threatens immediate casualties on the basis of an uncertain future benefit?”There are two likely ways this pandemic will end now that the virus is so widespread: 1) So many people will get it that we’ll develop a natural herd immunity, a term that is used to describe people getting a disease and becoming immune as a result, or 2) we’ll make and widely produce an affordable vaccine. It is very unlikely that we’ll see a big decline in Covid-19 cases solely due to the weather getting warmer. Plenty of places where there is currently warm weather, like Singapore and Australia, have Covid-19 cases.There are no easy answers. “We have to recognize that we’re gonna start seeing a fair number of hospital admissions, especially ICU admissions,” Hotez says, “and we have to ask the hard questions about what treatment we can do now.” Developing a vaccine will take many months at best, which is why in the meantime, changing your behavior is so important.Ultimately, “this is a new disease, so while we’re trying to make new predictions about risk, all bets are off,” says Choi. “We’re learning as everything is evolving actively in real time.”",1
"To all my wonderful people in Liberia: While you are under lockdown, open your eyes please. If you see anything like this being installed in your communities, take a picture and post it online, and engage the government. This is how some of the 5G masts/poles/atenaes look. These things beam radiation that will make you sick and kill you in 3 to 6 months, and the symptoms are just like the novel Coronavirus, but they do even more damage to the human body like respitory fatality, heart, deformed babes, destruction of sperm, teeth and much more! The mainline media is heavily paid to disassociate 5G and Coronavirus, and many times, shame anybody that does. But it EVIL if our government put you indoors and letor telecom companies do things that bring harm. Religious leaders, good politicians, business people and the general public, if you see these 5G masts, you better get out of the house and talk and stop it! There are other priorities that need attention, not high technology that destroys!",0
"Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China, was chosen to be China’s first 5G “smart city” and the location of China’s first smart 5G highway.  Wuhan is also the center of the horrendous coronavirus epidemic.  The possible linkage between these two events was first discussed in an Oct. 31, 2019 article entitled:  “Wuhan was the province where 5G was rolled out, now the center of deadly virus”  https://5g-emf.com/wuhan-was-the-province-where-5g-was-rolled-out-now-the-center-of-deadly-virus. The question that is being raised here is not whether 5G is responsible for the virus, but rather whether 5G radiation, acting via VGCC activation may be exacerbating the viral replication or the spread or lethality of the disease.  Let’s backtrack and look at the recent history of 5G in Wuhan in order to get some perspective on those questions.  An Asia Times article, dated Feb. 12, 2019 (https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/02/article/china-to-launch-first-5g-smart-highway) stated that there were 31 different 5G base stations (that is antennae) in Wuhan at the end of 2018.  There were plans developed later such that approximately 10,000 5G antennae would be in place at the end of 2019, with most of those being on 5G LED smart street lamps.  The first such smart street lamp was put in place on May 14, 2019 (www.china.org.cn/china/2019-05/14/content_74783676.htm), but large numbers only started being put in place in October, 2019, such that there was a furious pace of such placement in the last 2 ½ months of 2019.  These findings show that the rapid pace of the coronavirus epidemic developed at least roughly as the number of 5G antennae became extraordinarily high.  So we have this finding that China’s 1st 5G smart city and smart highway is the epicenter of this epidemic and this finding that the epidemic only became rapidly more severe as the numbers of 5G antennae skyrocketed. Are these findings coincidental or does 5G have some causal role in exacerbating the coronavirus epidemic?  In order to answer that question, we need to determine whether the downstream effects of VGCC activation exacerbate the viral replication, the effects of viral infection, especially those that have roles in the spread of the virus and also the mechanism by which this coronavirus causes death.Accordingly, the replication of the viral RNA is stimulated by oxidative stress:",0
"IS THERE A CONNECTION?ALERT: PRELIMINARY RESEARCH BY DR. MAGDA HAVAS, PHD, SHOWS AN APPARENT CONNECTION, IN THE UNITED STATES, BETWEEN 5G, MORE COVID-19 CASES, AND COVID-19 DEATHS.Covid-19 cases per million are 95% higher and covid-19 deaths per million are 126% higher in states with 5G. IN AUGUST, 2019, A HOST OF PROMINENT SCIENTISTS WARNED THAT THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE PROVIDED STRONG EVIDENCE FOR 5G’S MICROWAVE AND MILLIMETER WAVE EMISSIONS TO HAVE “A SYSTEMIC EFFECT ON IMMUNE FUNCTION” AND “ACCELERATED VIRAL REPLICATION” in a formal review article.  At this writing, an increasing number of scientists and lay people feel there may be a link to 5G & coronavirus. The scientists’ warnings were ignored by industry and gov’t last summer – and this status persists even now, in March, 2020, when we are in the midst of a pandemic, following the initial rollout of 5G in China, with Wuhan, China, Hubei Province being the epicenter of both the 5G rollout and where the COVID-19 coronavirus broke out in Dec. 2019.5G infrastructure exposures lower our immune system, as does wireless exposures to microwave radiation. 5G frequencies cause accelerated viral replication.Wuhan China is the world’s first “smart city” with 10,000 small cells deployed and activated in the last 2.5 months of 2019, which is exactly when this COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak occurred.Can the association be proven? Do we have time and capacity to do so, in the face of this world emergency? Neither is likely, though we have no doubt this factor will be investigated and discussed for years to come.However, we can take meaningful precautionary, prudent action based on this information. In order to potentially slow the effect of coronavirus, at the very least, we strongly suggest that, under the current “state of emergency” in many nations, states, and locales, all 5G infrastructure should be deactivated and halted, using an abundance of caution! All 5G satellites being deployed should be deactivated and halted. Please also consider turning off and reducing use of as much personal and commercial wireless as possible.",0
"Two documents reprinted on, each argue that there are reasons to think that 5G radiation is greatly stimulating the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and therefore, an important public health measure would be to shut down the 5G antennae and particularly the small cell 5G antennae in close proximity to our homes, schools, businesses, house of worship and hospitals. The first of these documents [1] published by Miller et al., concerns the impact of 5G radiation on the immune system of the body and also suggests that 5G radiation may also increase the replication of the virus. In both of these ways, 5G radiation may be expected to make the COVID-19 pandemic much worse. The second of these documents [1] is my own and is derived from a larger document on 5G radiation effects [2]. It starts with the history of 5G in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic. Wuhan is China’s first 5G “smart city” and is the location of China’s first 5G highway where 5G radiation is being used to test self-driving vehicles. Approximately 10,000 5G antennae were installed and activated in Wuhan in 2019, with approximately 75 to 80% of these installed and activated in the last 2 ½ months of the year. The epidemic was first detected near the beginning of that 2 ½ month period and became vastly more severe, with extremely large increases in numbers of cases and in deaths by the end of 2019. That may, of course be coincidental. The death rate in other parts of China from COVID-19 infections has been substantially lower than that in Wuhan with its unparalleled high numbers of 5G antennae (Xu et al., BMJ 2020; 368:m606) – that of course could also be coincidental. South Korea, which became the site of the worst epidemic outside of China, has large numbers of 5G antennae all over the country. The Milan area of Italy, currently, the worst epicenter in Europe also is a 5G center. And Seattle area, which was the worst area in the U.S. is also a major 5G area. New York City has become the largest epicenter in the US is another 5G site. These non-Chinese epidemic areas are not discussed in my paper, but these findings are accurate. Again, the locations of these epicenters in 5G areas may be coincidental.These figures add to the argument that 5G radiation may have a substantial role in exacerbating the COVID-19 pandemic – they are not definitive however and we must look to the mechanism of action of EMFs and the evidence that other EMFs produce similar, if less severe effects which are similar to but less severe than what we are apparently seeing following 5G exposure. Electromagnetic fields, including the highly pulsed and therefore highly dangerous 5G millimeter wave radiation, act via activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) with VGCC activation producing five different effects, each of which have roles in stimulating the replication and spread of coronaviruses. Excessive intracellular calcium. Oxidative stress. NF-kappaB elevation. Inflammation. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) The predominant cause of death in the COVID-19 epidemic, is pneumonia and each of these five effects also have roles in pneumonia, such that each of them is predicted to greatly increase the percent of people dying in this epidemic. It seems highly plausible that 5G radiation is greatly increasing the spread of the epidemic and also the death rate in individuals that are infected. You may wish to consider all of this in conjunction with the broader findings with regard to the dangers of 5G and other effects apparently produced by 5G exposures. How then did we get to this state? Many independent scientists, including myself, have argued that there should be no 5G rollout until there is extensive biological safety testing of genuine 5G radiation with all of its dangerous modulating pulses. However the industry has refused to get independent 5G testing and the FCC and other regulatory agencies have refused to require such testing. Furthermore, the EMF “safety guidelines” which are supposed to protect us from health impacts of EMF radiation have been shown, based on eight different types of highly repeated studies, to fail massively to predict biological effects. They therefore fail to predict safety [3]. It follows from this that all assurances of safety based on these “safety guidelines” are fraudulent. Consequently, there is no evidence whatsoever of 5G safety and much evidence of lack of safety. It is my opinion, therefore, that 5G radiation is greatly stimulating the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and also the major cause of death, pneumonia and therefore, an important public health measure would be to shut down the 5G antennae, particularly the small cell 5G antennae in close proximity to our homes, schools, businesses, houses of worship and hospitals.

That paper has been cited 255 times according to the Google Scholar database.  Most new scientific paradigms are only slowly accepted and this is much, much faster than usual. I have given 59 invited professional talks on this topic in 15 countries, including 4 prestigious keynote addresses.  I had been scheduled to give 1 more prestigious keynote address in April (has been postponed because of COVID-19). Two of my papers, my neuropsychiatric paper and my Wi-Fi paper, are each described by the publishing journal as being the most often downloaded paper in the history of each journal – stunning scientific  interest in both papers.My recent talks, one sponsored by the Dept. of Engineering and Applied Science at Queens University and the other at the World Congress on Physics in Berlin (where I was given a certificate of recognition) show together that both engineers and physicists are starting to realize the importance of this mechanism.",0

Variable oligomerization modes in coronavirus non-structural protein 9.  Ponnusamy R, Moll R, Weimar T, Mesters JR, Hilgenfeld R.Other aspects of viral replication including those involved in the spread of the virus are stimulated by increased intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i, oxidative stress, NF-kappaB elevation, inflammation and apoptosis, each of which are increased following EMF exposure.  The first citation below shows an important role of VGCC activation in stimulating coronavirus infection.The predominant cause of death from this coronavirus is pneumonia.  Pneumonia is greatly exacerbated by each of those five downstream effects of VGCC activation, excessive intracellular calcium, oxidative stress, NF-kappaB elevation, inflammation and apoptosis. The first of the citations listed below shows that calcium channel blockers, the same type of drugs that block EMF effects, are useful in the treatment of pneumonia.  This predicts that EMFs, acting via VGCC activation, will produce increasingly severe pneumonia and therefore 5G radiation as well as other types of EMFs may well increase pneumonia deaths.These all argue that 5G radiation is likely to greatly exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus and to greatly increase the lethality of the infections produced by it.  The good news is that it is likely that those of us that live in areas with no 5G radiation and who avoid other EMFs wherever possible will probably escape much of the impacts of this prospective global pandemic.  It is highly probable that one of the best things Wuhan can do to control the epidemic in the city is to turn off the 4G/5G system.",0
Wuhan is where 5G was rolled out first.5G wrecks immune systems and that is why people in Wuhan are suffering with this illness.The Wuhan coronavirus is a more virulent version of the normal cold.,0
"The coronavirus pandemic has completely changed our way of life, shut down entire countries and shuttered businesses across the globe. After an initial outbreak of disease in Wuhan, China, that began in December 2019, the novel virus has spread to over 180 countries, with the US and the European nations of Spain, Italy and France the worst hit. As scientists and researchers race toward a vaccine, governments are attempting to mitigate the economic damage with stimulus checks and tax cuts and contain further spread of the disease with social distancing measures and lockdowns.Researchers linked the pathogen to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses in January. That family contains viruses responsible for previous outbreaks of the respiratory diseases SARS and MERS, as well as some cases of the common cold. On March 11, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, announced the outbreak of the disease, dubbed COVID-19, would be declared a pandemic. It is the first time any coronavirus has been characterized as such.The situation continues to evolve as more information becomes available. We've collated everything we know about the virus, what's next for researchers, what steps you can take to reduce your risk, how to deal with quarantines and lockdowns, and how governments are providing assistance such as stimulus checks.
Our coronavirus pandemic hub will show you the latest stories. Clicking on the titles below will take you to the relevant section of the guide:What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses belong to a family known as ""Coronaviridae,"" and under an electron microscope they look like spiked rings. They're named for these spikes, which form a halo or ""crown"" (corona is Latin for crown) around the viral body. Coronaviruses contain a single strand of RNA (as opposed to DNA, which is double-stranded) within their viral body (or ""viral envelope""). As a virus, they can't reproduce without getting inside living cells and hijacking the machinery within. The spikes on the viral envelope help coronaviruses bind to cells, and then get inside them as if jimmying their way through a locked door. Once inside, they turn the cell into a virus factory -- the RNA and a handful of enzymes use the cell's machinery to produce more viruses, which are then shipped out of the cell and infect other cells. Thus, the cycle starts anew.Coronavirus in pictures: Scenes from around the world. Typically, these types of viruses are found in animals ranging from livestock and household pets to wildlife such as bats. Some are responsible for disease, like the common cold. If they make the jump to humans, they can cause fever, respiratory illness and inflammation in the lungs. In immunocompromised individuals, such as the elderly or those with HIV-AIDS, such viruses can cause severe respiratory illness, resulting in pneumonia and even death.Extremely pathogenic coronaviruses were behind the diseases SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) over the last two decades. These viruses were easily transmitted from human to human but were suspected to have passed through different animal intermediaries: SARS was traced to civet cats and MERS to dromedary camels. SARS, which showed up in the early 2000s, infected more than 8,000 people and resulted in nearly 800 deaths. MERS, which appeared in the early 2010s, infected almost 2,500 people and led to more than 850 deaths.You're going to be inundated with new terms and phrases you may never have heard before during this pandemic -- if you're finding yourself confused, head to CNET's guide on the most commonly used phrases.What is COVID-19?In the early days of the outbreak, the media, medical experts and health professionals were referring to ""the coronavirus"" as a catch-all term to discuss the outbreak of illness. But a coronavirus is a type of virus, rather than the virus or the disease it causes. To alleviate the confusion and streamline reporting, the WHO has named the new disease COVID-19 (for coronavirus disease 2019). ""Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing,"" said WHO's Tedros. ""It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks.""The Coronavirus Study Group, part of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, was responsible for naming the novel coronavirus itself. The novel coronavirus -- the one that causes the disease -- is known as SARS-CoV-2. The group ""formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs),"" the species responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003. In the simplest terms: The novel coronavirus is officially named SARS-CoV-2. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is officially named COVID-19. What is a pandemic? On March 11, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. ""Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death,"" said Tedros at a press briefing.So what is it?Both the CDC and the WHO have different definitions, and if you look in a dictionary, you may find something different again. In the simplest terms, a pandemic can be defined as ""a worldwide outbreak of a new disease."" The ""new"" is key here, because many diseases persist in the population and spread each year. For example, influenza (the flu) infects a lot of people every year and can be found across the world. Unlike COVID-19, it's been circulating in the community for centuries and there's some natural immunity to it, plus we know so much about it we can protect ourselves against common strains. What does this all mean? The COVID-19 virus itself didn't change. It hasn't become more dangerous and hasn't mutated to infect people more quickly. And the risk of being infected doesn't exponentially increase now that the word ""pandemic"" is being used. But it's a way to describe what's happening and more succinctly understand the urgency of the situation.Where did the virus come from?The virus appears to have originated in Wuhan, a Chinese city about 650 miles south of Beijing that has a population of more than 11 million people. Prestigious medical journal The Lancet published an extensive summary of the clinical features of some of the first patients infected with the disease stretching back to Dec. 1, 2019. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells fish, as well as a panoply of meat from other animals, including bats, snakes and pangolins, was implicated in the original spread in early January. However, the very first patient identified had not been exposed to the market, suggesting the virus may have originated elsewhere and been transported to the market, where it was able to thrive or jump into new hosts -- whether human or animal. Chinese authorities shut down the market on Jan. 1. Live animal markets have been implicated in the origin and spread of viral diseases in past epidemics. A majority of the people confirmed to have come down with the coronavirus in the early days of the outbreak had been to the Huanan Seafood marketplace in previous weeks. The market appears to be an integral piece of the puzzle, but research into the likely origin and connecting a ""patient zero"" to the initial spread is ongoing. A group of Chinese scientists uploaded a paper to preprint website biorXiv, having studied the viral genetic code and compared it to the previous SARS coronavirus and other bat coronaviruses. They discovered the genetic similarities run deep: The virus shares 80% of its genes with the previous SARS virus and 96% of its genes with bat coronaviruses. Importantly, the study also demonstrated the virus can get into and hijack cells the same way SARS did, using a human receptor known as ACE2.A paper published in the journal Nature Medicine on March 17 assessed the genome of the virus in great detail, coming to similar conclusions to the preprint, categorically stating that it arose due to natural evolution. ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" wrote the collaboration of researchers from institutions across the US, UK and Australia. The ant-eating pangolin, a small, scaly mammal, has also been implicated in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. According to The New York Times, it may be one of the most trafficked animals in the world. The virus likely originated in bats but may have been able to hide out in the pangolin, before spreading from that animal to humans. Researchers caution that the full data hasn't yet been published, but coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found in pangolins before. All good science builds off previous discoveries -- and there is still more to learn about the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2 before we have a good grasp of exactly which animal vector is responsible for transmission -- but the genetic sequence of the virus is a clue: It tells us the virus must have originated in bats and may have jumped through an intermediary to a human.How do we know it's a new coronavirus?The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention dispatched a team of scientists to Wuhan to gather information about the new disease and to perform testing in patients, hoping to isolate the virus. Their work, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Jan. 24, examined samples from three patients. Using an electron microscope, which can resolve images of cells and their internal structures, and studying the genetic code, the team visualized and genetically identified the novel coronavirus.Understanding the genetic code helps researchers in two ways: It allows them to create tests that can identify the virus from patient samples, and it gives them potential insight into creating treatments or vaccines.The Peter Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia, was able to identify and grow the virus in a lab from a patient sample, and announced its discovery on Jan. 28. This provides laboratories with the capability to both assess and provide expert information to health authorities and detect the virus in patients suspected of harboring the disease. It's also a valuable step in crafting a viable vaccine. How does the coronavirus spread?This is one of the major questions researchers struggled to answer in the early days of the outbreak but now seems pretty settled. The first infections were potentially the result of animal-to-human transmission, but confirmation of human-to-human transmission was obtained in late January. As the virus spread, local transmission was seen across the world.The WHO says the virus can move from person to person via:Respiratory droplets -- when a person sneezes or coughs.Direct contact with infected individuals.Contact with contaminated surfaces and objects.A handful of viruses, including MERS, can survive for periods in the air after being sneezed or coughed from an infected individual. Although recent reports suggest the novel coronavirus may be transmitted in this way, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention have reiterated there is no evidence for this. Writing in The Conversation on Feb. 14, virologists Ian Mackay and Katherine Arden explain ""no infectious virus has been recovered from captured air samples.""
Further research has shown SARS-CoV-2 may linger in the air for extended periods of time, which is particularly notable for health workers. It's estimated the virus can stay suspended in the air for a period of about 30 minutes. Social distancing measures become ever more important here because only those close to infected individuals are expected to be exposed to large quantities of the virus in the air. How long can the coronavirus survive on surfaces?
There's still a lot to learn about the hardiness of this particular virus, but similar members of the coronavirus family have been explored in detail, including the coronaviruses responsible for the SARS and MERS outbreaks. Particularly notable is an article published on Feb. 6 in The Journal of Hospital Infection, which looked at a host of previous studies (22 in total) and found coronaviruses may persist on surfaces for up to nine days. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17 took a deeper look at how stable the SARS-CoV-2 virus is in the air and on surfaces. There's a chance the virus survives on cardboard for up to 24 hours, while on copper surfaces it seems to only survive for around 4 hours. On plastic and steel, it might survive up to three days.A chief concern for the public has been whether package shipments could help spread the virus. Different materials can keep the virus alive for longer outside the body, but a range of factors needs to be taken into account when evaluating virus survival. The CDC is still investigating this but has come up with numbers for certain surfaces.The CDC will continue to investigate but believes the risk of contracting coronavirus from packages is still low. The WHO notes it is ""very unlikely"" you would see the coronavirus persist after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions. Best tip? Wash your hands after handling any packages if you're concerned (and just wash your hands, a lot, in general). What are the symptoms?The new coronavirus causes symptoms similar to those of previously identified disease-causing coronaviruses. In currently identified patients, there seems to be a spectrum of illness: A large number experience mild pneumonia-like symptoms, while others have a much more severe response.On Jan. 24, the prestigious medical journal The Lancet published an extensive analysis of the clinical features of the disease.According to the report, patients present with this symptoms:Fever, elevated body temperature.Dry cough.Fatigue or muscle pain.Breathing difficulties.Less common symptoms include these:Coughing up mucus or blood.Headaches.Diarrhea.Kidney failure. As the disease progresses, patients also develop pneumonia, which inflames the lungs and causes them to fill with fluid. This can be detected by an X-ray. How infectious is the coronavirus?The ""r nought"" (R0) value of the coronavirus is an indicator of how successfully it spreads from person to person. This metric helps determine the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease. In the simplest terms, the value relates to how many people can be infected by one person carrying the disease. 
Infectious diseases such as measles have an R0 of 12 to 18, which is remarkably high. The SARS epidemic of 2002-2003 had an R0 of around 3. A handful of studies modeling the COVID-19 outbreak have given a similar value with a range between 1.4 and 3.8. However, there is plenty of variation between studies and models attempting to predict the R0 of novel coronavirus due to the constantly changing number of cases. It seems to have settled on a figure around 2.2, meaning every infected person infects 2 others. It should be stressed these studies are informative, but they aren't definitive and because the virus spreads differently depending on location and the severity of lockdown/quarantine measures, it can vary by country. ""Some experts are saying it is the most infectious virus ever seen -- that is not correct,"" says Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Australia.Another aspect impacting the spread of the disease is whether it spreads before symptoms are present or without showing symptoms at all. This appears to be true, but it's more likely you'll have mild symptoms. This complicates matters because it allows people to spread the disease without even knowing. This also makes airport screening less impactful, because harboring the disease but showing no signs could allow it to insidiously spread further.How many cases are asymptomatic? It's still hard to tell. Various analyses have been undertaken in the past three months to try to establish a figure, with the number of asymptomatic cases ranging from 10% up to 50% of cases. This is why there's been a move to screen and test people who aren't showing symptoms -- they might be spreading the disease unknowingly, so identifying them would prevent continuous spread through the community.Should you make your own hand sanitizer?A panic surrounding the spread of the coronavirus has gripped consumers, and store shelves have been emptied. Shoppers have raced out to buy up whatever they can: toilet paper, acetaminophen (also know as paracetamol), pasta and, of course, hand sanitizer. As CNET Wellness editor Sarah Mitroff reports, most places in the US have sold out of the latter, as have many online stores.That led to widespread reports about making your own hand sanitizer -- but experts warn that you risk making a sanitizer that either isn't effective or is way too harsh. In CNET's guide to DIY hand sanitizer, we also rule out using hard liquor. Recipes that call for vodka or spirits should be avoided entirely, because you need a high-proof liquor to get the right concentration of alcohol by volume. That's because most liquor is mixed with water, so if you mix an 80-proof vodka (which is the standard proof) with aloe, you'll have hand sanitizer that contains roughly only 40% alcohol. The alternative is to wash your hands. As the CDC and WHO continue to suggest, washing your hands with soap and water for around 20 seconds is one of the best ways to protect yourself from getting sick right now. You should also avoid touching your face if you can, as the virus can be transferred into the body if you've been in contact with someone who's infected. Is there a treatment for the coronavirus?Coronaviruses are hardy organisms. They're effective at hiding from the human immune system, and we haven't developed any reliable treatments or vaccines to eradicate them. In most cases, health officials attempt to deal with the symptoms.""There is no recognized therapeutic against coronaviruses,"" said Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, during a press conference on Jan. 29. That still holds true at present. ""The primary objective in an outbreak related to a coronavirus is to give adequate support of care to patients, particularly in terms of respiratory support and multiorgan support.""  Notably, because they are viruses, coronaviruses are not susceptible to antibiotics. Antibiotics are medicines designed to fight bacteria and don't do any damage to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 as yet, though a number are in the works including experimental antivirals, which can attack the virus, and existing drugs targeted at other viruses like HIV which have shown some promise.Can you take ibuprofen for coronavirus?Ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug sold under various names such as Brufen, Nurofen and Advil, has been linked with adverse outcomes for patients with COVID-19. It's important to stress there are no studies to point to specifically looking at ibuprofen usage and adverse outcomes for COVID-19, but French health officials have questioned whether it's a safe way to treat the fever associated with the disease.There have been conflicting messages from the World Health Organization, which appeared to suggest on March 17 to avoid ibuprofen and use paracetamol instead. A Twitter thread on March 18 clarified there are concerns with using the drug to treat fever in people with COVID-19, but the organization is ""not aware of reports of any negative effects, beyond the usual ones that limit its use in certain populations"".Those populations include people over 65 years of age and those suffering from conditions such as asthma, high blood pressure and liver or kidney problems. An article in The Lancet on March 11 showed the expression of the ACE2 receptor on human cells -- which the coronavirus uses to get inside and replicate -- may be increased due to ibuprofen use. Mixed messages and misinformation have been spreading online in regard to ibuprofen use so it's important to remember to check in with official health sources like the WHO. The BBC, speaking to British health experts, notes it's probably best to stick to paracetamol as a first choice. Is there a vaccine for coronavirus?Developing new vaccines takes time and they must be rigorously tested and confirmed safe via clinical trials before they can be routinely used in humans. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US, has frequently stated that a vaccine is at least a year to 18 months away. Experts agree there's a ways to go yet. However, there is great progress being made, and a number of vaccine candidates have appeared in the time since COVID-19 was discovered. We've collated everything we know about potential vaccines and current treatment options that are being used around the world.In developing a vaccine that targets SARS-CoV-2, scientists are looking intensely at the spike proteins. These proteins, which are present on the surface of the virus, enable it to enter human cells where it can replicate and make copies of itself. Researchers have been able to map the projections in 3D, and research suggests they could be a viable antigen -- a fragment that stimulates the human body's immune system -- in any potential coronavirus vaccine. The protein is prevalent in coronaviruses we've battled in the past, too -- including the one that caused the SARS outbreak in China in 2002-03. This has given researchers a head start on building vaccines against part of the spike protein and, using animal models, they have already demonstrated an immune response.
Notably, SARS, which infected around 8,000 people and killed around 800, seemed to run its course and then mostly disappear. It wasn't a vaccine that turned the tide on the disease but rather effective communication between nations and a range of tools that helped track the disease and its spread.""We learnt that epidemics can be controlled without drugs or vaccines, using enhanced surveillance, case isolation, contact tracking, PPE and infection control measures,"" MacIntyre said.How to reduce your risk of coronavirus.The WHO recommends a range of measures to protect yourself from contracting the disease, based on good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene -- in much the same way you'd reduce the risk of contracting the flu. The novel coronavirus does spread and infect humans slightly differently to the flu, but because it predominantly affects the respiratory tract, the protection measures are similar.In early February, the US State Department issued a travel advisory with a blunt message: ""Do Not Travel. Avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19."" A similar warning from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people to ""avoid nonessential travel.""A Twitter thread, developed by the WHO, is below.You may also be considering buying a face mask to protect yourself from contracting the virus. You're not alone -- stocks of face masks have been selling out across the world, with Amazon and Walmart.com experiencing shortages. Reporting from Sydney in January, I found lines at the pharmacy extending down the street. Should I wear a face mask?The face mask has become a symbol of this pandemic. You'll see them no matter where you go these days, but the scientific underpinnings of using a mask to prevent coronavirus infection has been shaky. Advice has been revised time and again and varies depending on your location -- so check with your local health authority as to how you should proceed.That said, the US CDC in March revised its official guidelines for wearing a face covering in public settings. Due to a shortage of personal protective equipment across the country, some have even turned to making their own face masks -- what's the advice here? CNET's How To team has put together a complete guide on whether to wear a face mask or face covering and the exact recommendations that need to be followed.",1
"We doctors and psychotherapists oriented towards environmental medicine see a connection between radio interference, immunodeficiency and global epidemic.
We call for drastically reducing the burden of high-frequency exposure that is spreading worldwide,The inhabitants of the globe are currently experiencing an extensive wave of diseases due to the SARS Corona Virus 2. Elderly people (with often deficient vital substances) and those with previous illnesses or with a weakened immune system (e.g. due to the vitamin D deficiency, which is particularly prevalent in winter and spring) are particularly at risk. The losses in human life and the consequences for the economy and employees due to the politically prescribed massive contact restrictions cannot be estimated, nor can the psychosocial consequences.We, the undersigned doctors and psychotherapists, consider two other factors to be significant in addition to the above. In addition to the degree of infectivity of the virus, the susceptibility of the “host” plays a role, that is, specifically how well the immune system works and whether specific virus antibodies are missing or have already been formed. In prevention and therapy, the most important thing is to prevent a weakening of the immune system and, in addition, to strengthen the immune system therapeutically. Immune system damage occurs, for example, from widespread toxins, malnutrition, some medications, air pollution and certain lifestyle factors (alcohol, nicotine). In addition, there have been new harmful environmental influences for the past two decades, the effects of which we have seen more and more frequently in our medical and psychotherapeutic work. It is about the constant exposure to mobile communications (cell phones and smartphones and the associated base stations) and similar technologies with pulsed radio frequency (WLAN with the frequencies 2.4 and higher than 5 GHz, DECT cordless phones, baby phones, tablets, Bluetooth, "" Intelligent ""measuring systems - so-called"" smart meters "", radar, etc.).There is already a wealth of research results on the radio-operated devices mentioned and the previous mobile radio standards 2G (GSM), 3G (UMTS), 4G (LTE), which for the most part turned out to be unsettling. According to the opinion of many industry-independent experts, pulsed high-frequency technology is now considered to be one of the causes of numerous health problems (e.g. sleep disorders, headaches, behavioral disorders, depression and exhaustion), due to increased production of free radicals (""oxidative stress"") (inter alia: Yakymenko 2016). Furthermore, scientific research is available on changes in the heart rhythm, changes in gene expression, changes in metabolism, the development of stem cells, the development of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, DNA damage, effects on general wellbeing increased number of free radicals, learning and memory deficits, impaired sperm function and quality (see the list of scientific studies in: International Scientist Appeal 2015, Appeal: Stop 5G: Firstenberg 2018). Influences of high-frequency signals on the immune system were also determined (infection cluster near base stations, Waldmann-Selsam 2005) (Grigoriev 2012, Szmigielski 2013, Moskowitz 2020). In addition to undisturbed melatonin production (Reiter, Robinson 1995), vitamin D3 is crucial for the functioning of the immune system. The docking point for vitamin D3 (vitamin D receptor, VDR) is inhibited by mobile radio so that it cannot develop its immunoregulatory effect (Kaplan 2006, Marshall 2017) . Man is a bioelectromagnetic being, the living cells have electrical potentials (in the millivolt range) on the cell membranes. Their function can be disturbed by low-frequency electrical fields and radio. A weakening of the cell membrane potential demonstrably leads to different clinical symptoms. The Radiation Protection Commission (German: SSK) had already determined in 1991 that radio radiation below the limit values increases the calcium transport through the cell membrane (SSK 1991). Independent scientists are currently discussing the existence of voltage-dependent calcium channels, which, irritated by weak electromagnetic fields, can cause negative effects in the cell (Pall 2018). In a study by the Agricultural University of Wuhan, China, Bai and colleagues report that coronaviruses in the pig's intestinal epithelium increased the influx of calcium and thus promoted virus replication; The infection can be inhibited by special drugs, the calcium channel blockers (Bai 2020). A summary of the current scientific knowledge can be found in Diagnose Funk (NGO). (Diagnose: Funk 15.04.2020). 5G is already under construction in major German cities and in individual rural regions. A letter from Transport Minister Scheuer and Environment Minister Schulze from the beginning of April clearly shows what is required of the politically responsible persons in cities, municipalities and rural districts: ""You have to help find the location for the new mobile radio systems and ultimately support the planned transmitters on site"" (Südkurier 2020). Three different frequency ranges are used here: around 700 megahertz (used for large events), around 3.6 gigahertz (smart cities), around 26 gigahertz (indoor supply, supply networks). (German Federal Government 2017). This increases the antenna density and thus the radiation exposure of the population many times over. We consider the introduction of 5G and the disregard for the precautionary principle, to be highly risky, as no risk assessment has been carried out, disregarding the precautionary principle, and the few existing studies show highly questionable results. The persistently repeated reference by the industry and the authorities to the supposedly “safe limit values”, which were laid down in the 26th BImSchV, is misleading. The ICNIRP eV (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection), on whose recommendation to politicians the limit values are based, is biased because of its proximity to industry (ICNIRP and EPRS 2020, Starkey 2016 on SCENIHR 2015). The limit values relate only to short-term warming by mobile radio and do not offer protection to the population. In our view, the current situation with the dangerous SARS coronavirus requires decisive action.We doctors again appeal to all those responsible in government and healthcare:Stop 5G!Reduce the ubiquitous forced radiation of the population! Educate the population comprehensively about the harmful effects of mobile radio and the other high-frequency technologies mentioned here! Stop the dominant influence of the ICNIRP and the mobile radio lobby on the radiation protection commission, federal office for radiation protection and government! Instead of promoting state-of-the-art cell phone expansion and the cell phone industry, as before, it is now a top priority to support the health of the population, their ability to work and care by all means.For the health of all of us!",0
"Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China, was chosen to be China’s first 5G “smart city” and the location of China’s first smart 5G highway.  Wuhan is also the center of the horrendous coronavirus epidemic.  The possible linkage between these two events was first discussed in an Oct. 31, 2019 article entitled:  “Wuhan was the province where 5G was rolled out, now the center of deadly virus”  https://5g-emf.com/wuhan-was-the-province-where-5g-was-rolled-out-now-the-center-of-deadly-virus/The question that is being raised here is not whether 5G is responsible for the virus, but rather whether 5G radiation, acting via VGCC activation may be exacerbating the viral replication or the spread or lethality of the disease.  Let’s backtrack and look at the recent history of 5G in Wuhan in order to get some perspective on those questions.  An Asia Times article, dated Feb. 12, 2019 (https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/02/article/china-to-launch-first-5g-smart-highway) stated that there were 31 different 5G base stations (that is antennae) in Wuhan at the end of 2018. There were plans developed later such that approximately 10,000 5G antennae would be in place at the end of 2019, with most of those being on 5G LED smart street lamps.  The first such smart street lamp was put in place on May 14, 2019 (www.china.org.cn/china/2019-05/14/content_74783676.htm), but large numbers only started being put in place in October, 2019, such that there was a furious pace of such placement in the last 2 ½ months of 2019.  These findings show that the rapid pace of the coronavirus epidemic developed at least roughly as the number of 5G antennae became extraordinarily high.  So we have this finding that China’s 1st 5G smart city and smart highway is the epicenter of this epidemic and this finding that the epidemic only became rapidly more severe as the numbers of 5G antennae skyrocketed.Are these findings coincidental or does 5G have some causal role in exacerbating the coronavirus epidemic?  In order to answer that question, we need to determine whether the downstream effects of VGCC activation exacerbate the viral replication, the effects of viral infection, especially those that have roles in the spread of the virus and also the mechanism by which this coronavirus causes death.Accordingly, the replication of the viral RNA is stimulated by oxidative stress:ther aspects of viral replication including those involved in the spread of the virus are stimulated by increased intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i, oxidative stress, NF-kappaB elevation, inflammation and apoptosis, each of which are increased following EMF exposure.  The first citation below shows an important role of VGCC activation in stimulating coronavirus infection.The predominant cause of death from this coronavirus is pneumonia.  Pneumonia is greatly exacerbated by each of those five downstream effects of VGCC activation, excessive intracellular calcium, oxidative stress, NF-kappaB elevation, inflammation and apoptosis. The first of the citations listed below shows that calcium channel blockers, the same type of drugs that block EMF effects, are useful in the treatment of pneumonia.  This predicts that EMFs, acting via VGCC activation, will produce increasingly severe pneumonia and therefore 5G radiation as well as other types of EMFs may well increase pneumonia deaths.These all argue that 5G radiation is likely to greatly exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus and to greatly increase the lethality of the infections produced by it.  The good news is that it is likely that those of us that live in areas with no 5G radiation and who avoid other EMFs wherever possible will probably escape much of the impacts of this prospective global pandemic.  It is highly probable that one of the best things Wuhan can do to control the epidemic in the city is to turn off the 4G/5G system.",0
"At last, the first study has emerged regarding the very clear relationship between “coronavirus” outbreaks and the presence of 5G networks.  Thanks to Claire Edwards for making this available in English. The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects in early 2020 have surprised scientists and politicians. If any study aimed at understanding the phenomenon and which consequently may help to clarify the causes of the pandemic is carried out, it should be promoted and/or taken into consideration. The correlation between cases of coronavirus and the presence of 5G networks has been addressed in alternative media and social networks. It is noteworthy that, at least in Spain, the media have not covered the scientific studies on the subject of 5G, nor asked the government any questions about this in the daily press conferences that it conducts to report on the state of the situation. The team of scientists advising the Spanish government has also failed to raise this issue.It is common sense that the ability to demonstrate this correlation would be very important data to contribute to the understanding of, and the solution to, the problem.Objective.To assess whether a correlation exists between cases of coronavirus and the presence of 5G networks. Without entering for the moment into subsequent cause-effect approaches in the case of positive results. Given that there is a sufficiently large statistical sample, it is possible for the results obtained to have a high level of reliability.Material and methods.The study has benefited from the official statistical material published daily, which is a basic and valuable tool. It should be noted that in these publications, the methodology used for counting cases of coronavirus infections does not generally provide real data. In Spain and many other countries, it has not been calculated as there are not enough tests for such analyses. However, this does not alter the results of this study since it is based on the comparative rather than the absolute method of infection. Therefore, in order to avoid statistical error, we will compare the density value of confirmed cases of coronavirus (expressed in number of cases per 1000 inhabitants) instead of absolute values. Since the criterion for counting used by the health authorities within the same state or city is the same, the comparison of published values for different cities or regions will be equally reliable for statistics. Comparisons between different countries of confirmed cases, excluding asymptomatic cases, will be equally reliable. The possible exception of some non-transparent country that could manipulate the publication of its data is beyond the control of this study.The method used was to compare the incidence (no. of cases per 1000 inhabitants) between countries with and without 5G technology. Between regions of the same country with and without 5G technology. Between cities of the same state with and without 5G technology. Between different neighbourhoods of the same city with the 5G network map of that city. Comparing states with common borders with and without 5G technology. Comparing the case of one state within another, as is the case of San Marino.The data for each chart were taken on the same day. Graphic results and data published below:Findings The results obtained demonstrate a clear and close relationship between the rate of coronavirus infections and 5G antenna location.This study does not analyse the beneficial or harmful effects on humans of 5G electromagnetic radiation. However, it does indicate a possible cause-effect in the current pandemic.A “border effect” is significant, original and unique to this pandemic: it presents marked differences between contiguous states with and without 5G installation. it is particularly significant that the countries bordering China have very low rates of infection. One may also compare between Mexico and the USA or between Portugal and Spain, etc.The case of San Marino is particularly significant. It was the first state in the world to install 5G and therefore, the state whose citizens have been exposed to 5G radiation the longest, and suspiciously, the first state in the world with infections. The probability of this happening is 1 in 37,636. In the cities studied, Madrid, Barcelona and New York, this correlation is also observed. In the study of the city of Barcelona (pp. 7-8), it can be seen that the socio- economic factor plays a significant role.It is very significant that on the African continent, with scarce health resources but without 5G, the rate of infection is very low, except for some antennas in South Africa, which also presents the highest rates of infection in Africa.The rates of infection are diluted. The rates of some regions are influenced by cities with 5G, but the rates of infection of these cities are diluted in those of the region to which they belong. So it is more significant, as is the case of Spain, to compare uniprovincial autonomous regions, than among those that are formed by 3 or more of the old provinces. Thus we see that some regions with 5G such as Rioja, Madrid and Navarra, have rates between 4 and 8 times higher than others without 5G. The same is true in other cities around the world where the 5G network does not cover the entire territory of the state or region.These data and results have the value of being taken “in vivo”, not based on prospective or laboratory studies. Never before have we had so much epidemiological information about a disease in humans to be able to produce scientific studies. A means of answering the question of cause and effect would be to disconnect the 5G networks, at least as a preventive measure, and see the results of the evolution of cases of coronavirus. So would studying the rate of infection in a state that declared a 5G moratorium after the pandemic started and studying if the statistics change. Given the evidence presented here, the data and conclusions of this study urgently need to be given due consideration. Given the current gravity of the pandemic, the media and political and health authorities have a responsibility to take urgent action. A failure to act in the face of the findings of this study could be considered negligent at the very least and very possibly criminal.",0
"Robert Kennedy Jr. claims that Bill Gates owns the World Health Organization (WHO) and called the Microsoft founder ""the most powerful man in public health.""
Kennedy Jr., the son of Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of John F. Kennedy, made the claims in an interview on YouTube channel Valuetainment, on May 2, 2020. Kennedy claimed that Gates provides 10% of the WHO's budget and said that the WHO ""begs and rolls over"" for Gates' funding. He claimed that Gates had used his influence to shift the WHO's approach to disease eradication. Kennedy said that the WHO used to employ a policy of eliminating disease by eliminating poverty. He said that the best way of eliminating a disease was by providing impoverished communities with adequate resources, like clean water, sanitation, and sufficient and nutritional food. However, he alleges that Gates has shifted this approach. Kennedy claims that Gates has shifted the WHO's attention toward eradicating disease through vaccination. ""He believes the only path to good health is inside a syringe,"" Kennedy claimed in the two-hour-long interview. Half of the WHO's budget goes towards Gates' polio vaccine program, according to Kennedy, who alleges that the vaccine is actually spreading polio. He alleged that the Gates Foundation's polio vaccine has caused polio epidemics around the world in places that have not seen polio for decades and said that 70% of polio cases on earth are coming from the Gates vaccine. ""I think that Gates is well-intended in the same way that missionaries who brought smallpox to the Indians were well-intended. I think he believes that he is somehow ordained divinely to bring salvation to the world through technology."" Bill Gates has donated more than $300 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and aims to introduce a Global Vaccine Action Plan to combat disease around the world. Kennedy also weighed in with some outrageous theories about the new 5G network, which is currently being rolled out across the world. He said that Bill Gates would have ""complete control of our society"" through 5G. Kennedy alleged that Gates has invested heavily in 5G networks and owns hundreds of thousands of ground antennae. Kennedy claimed that authorities would use 5G to track movements to know where an individual is at any given moment. ""5G is not about helping you download your video game quickly,"" he said. ""5G is about surveillance and it's about data harvesting."" He said that the current lockdown measures that are in place during the COVID-19 pandemic are training society to do what it's told. ""This pandemic is teaching us to accept this kind of surveillance, to accept these constraints on our civil rights, to allow the government to come in and tell us that we must stay at home and not send our kids to school."" Perhaps Kennedy's most outrageous claim was that Bill Gates is installing chips in people across America. He said that these chips could be used to store a person's medical records but said that they would be used for something far more sinister. He said that a police officer could potentially scan the chip in the middle of an investigation to search a person's criminal record or their previous locations. Reuters published an article on May 5 debunking Kennedy's microchip claim. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is known for his controversial and bizarre theories.He is notoriously and controversially anti-vaccination and his own family members penned an op-ed in Politico last year challenging his campaign of ""misinformation"" about vaccination.

"Robert F. Kennedy's son claims that Dr. Tony Fauci and the Gates Foundation stand to make a hefty profit from the manufacture of the COVID-19 vaccine.Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of Robert and nephew of John F. Kennedy, said that the National Institute for Allergic and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Fauci's agency, will collect 50% of all royalties from a potential coronavirus vaccine. Kennedy Jr said that Dr. Fauci owns a number of vaccine patents, including one that is being trialed to fight coronavirus by some of America's biggest vaccine manufacturers. The Gates Foundation invests in Dr. Fauci's NIAID as part of its Decade of Vaccines program which aims to introduce a Global Vaccine Action Plan. Kennedy Jr said that Dr. Fauci owns a patent for a specific type of vaccine that packages a virus in a protein sheet. The virus is then delivered to the human body through the vaccine and Kennedy Jr said that it very quickly reaches the organs necessary to give a person immunity to a certain illness. He also said that the patent is currently being used by at least one of the major American vaccine manufacturers to make vaccines for coronavirus. The four major vaccine manufacturers in the US are Pfizer, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, and Sanofi, and if one of those four companies successfully develops a Coronavirus vaccine, Fauci and the NIAID stand to collect half of the royalties, according to Kennedy Jr.He said that companies who used that patent have to split the profits 50/50 with the NIAID and he claimed that the Gates Foundation had invested in that particular patent. He said that there was no limit on how much the NIAID can collect from the coronavirus vaccine and said that there need to be more government regulations to prevent it from doing so. ",0
"Bobby Kennedy Jr., the son of the late former US Attorney General and the nephew of the late President John F. Kennedy, is warning the world of the perils of vaccinations. He claims the push for more vaccines is all about the money.Bobby Kennedy Jr. was on a podcast this past week where he dropped some bombs about the perils of vaccinations.  In his interview at the 50:00 minute mark, Kennedy shares the following:You have the Vaccine Act of 86.  Now you have a project that has no liability so they have no incentive to make it safe.  Not only that they don’t have to test it and in fact they have an incentive not to test it because the only way you can get sued under the Vaccine Act is if you can show that the company knew of an injury and didn’t list it on the manufacturer’s insert.So there’s an incentive to know as little about the product as possible.  And, you can’t sue them, and there’s no market force that keeps them in check.  Because you can say that the vaccine is mandated for 78 million kids.  And, so the industry got together and manufacturers said, holy cow, now we have a product that has no liability, and that’s the biggest cost for drugs.  So they said, number one, we don’t have to test it, that’s a huge cost avoided.  Number two, there’s no liability and that’s the biggest cost avoided.  Number three, there’s no marketing or advertising costs, because it’s mandated.  So it’s just like printing money.If you can get a vaccine on the CDC’s recommended schedule it averages about a billion dollars annually in pure profits for your company .  When I was a kid I got three vaccines and was fully compliant and today’s kids get 72 vaccines.At the 59:00 minute mark, Kennedy shares the money and connections between Dr. Fauci and the Gates Foundation:Tony Fauci has many, many vaccine patents… and there’s one vaccine patent that he has that is a way of packaging a coronavirus with some other vaccine … in a protein sheet… and then delivering it through a vaccine… he somehow ended up owning that patent… Tony Fauci will be able to cash in …. So Fauci’s agency will collect half the royalties for that vaccine [related to the coronavirus].The above audio was shocking in describing the connections between Fauci and Gates and the alleged money they may make with a vaccine for the coronavirus.",0
"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Dafna Tachover, Director of 5G and Wireless Harms Project of Children’s Health Defense (CHD), signed onto the UK EM Radiation Research Trust  (RRT) letter calling on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and political leaders to protect the public from the proven harms of wireless radiation and 5G.The Open Letter of Complaint was written in response to an article published by First News in their children’s online newspaper titled “There is no 5G Conspiracy”, claiming 5G is absolutely safe. RRT, which is a trusted and leading UK group dedicated to education about wireless radiation health effects, has been receiving emails and phone calls from parents, school children and teachers asking RRT to respond to the article.The letter was written by RRT’s Chairwoman, Eileen O’Connor, and the group’s US based advisor, Susan Foster, and responds to the unsubstantiated and 0 claims by First News of the absolute safety of 5G. The letter provides ample scientific evidence of proven harms by wireless radiation and addresses how Big Telecom is defrauding the public.“The RRT believes that it is one thing to comfort children with respect to the lockdown and the corona virus,” said Ms. O’Conner, “but not at the cost of the truth about the very real harms from these dangerous exposures.”Since 5G infrastructure is based primarily on 4G, and on pulsed and modulated radio and microwave frequencies that have been proven harmful in thousands of studies, harms that have been confirmed by courts around the world, there is no doubt that 5G is harmful as well.“Children need to be told the truth: cell phones and cell towers emit radiation,” commented Ms. Foster. “It is ludicrous and shameful to tell children that a great deal of research has been done to prove 5G safe when decades of science on the biological effects of electromagnetic radiation have proven it harmful.”RFK, Jr., Dafna Tachover and CHD are calling for the protection of those who have already been harmed by wireless technology radiation, including many children, and for the prevention of further and imminent harm by halting 5G deployment.5G deployment is exponentially increasing our exposure to this harmful radiation and technology. Of special concern is the installation of cell phones antennas in close proximity to people’s homes and children’s bedrooms. As a result, growing numbers of countries and municipalities around the world have banned the deployment of 5G.Children’s Health Defense joined this effort as it is aligned with the organization’s mission to protect children from environmental toxins. 5G and wireless radiation constitute toxins which are significantly involved in the increase of sickness in children. Sadly, in the UK, a 15 y/o girl, Jenny Fry committed suicide after becoming sick from wireless and as a result of the mistreatment she has experienced because of her sickness.RFK, Jr., Dafna Tachover and CHD are calling for the protection of those who have already been harmed by wireless technology radiation including many children, and for the prevention of further and imminent harm by halting 5G deployment.",0
"U.S. military documents show that, in 1992, the CDC’s current Director Robert Redfield and his then-assistant, Deborah Birx—both Army medical officers—knowingly falsified scientific data published in the New England Journal of Medicine fraudulently claiming that an HIV vaccine they helped develop was effective. They knew the vaccine was worthless.Redfield now runs the agency charged with mandating COVID vaccines. Birx, a life-long protégé to both Redfield and Anthony Fauci, served on the board of Bill Gates’ Global Fund. Redfield, Birx and Fauci lead the White House coronavirus task force.A subsequent Air Force tribunal on Scientific Fraud and Misconduct agreed that Redfield’s misleading or, possibly, deceptive information seriously threatens his credibility as a researcher. In 1992, two military investigators charged Redfield and Birx with engaging in “a systematic pattern of data manipulation, inappropriate statistical analyses and misleading data presentation in an apparent attempt to promote the usefulness of the GP160 AIDS vaccine.” A subsequent Air Force tribunal on Scientific Fraud and Misconduct agreed that Redfield’s “misleading or, possibly, deceptive” information “seriously threatens his credibility as a researcher and has the potential to negatively impact AIDS research funding for military institutions as a whole. His allegedly unethical behavior creates 0 hope and could result in premature deployment of the vaccine.” The tribunal recommended investigation by a “fully independent outside investigative body.” Dr. Redfield confessed to D.O.D. interrogators and to the tribunal, that his analyses were faulty and deceptive. He agreed to publicly correct them. Afterward, he continued making his 0 claims at three subsequent international HIV conferences, and perjured himself in testimony before Congress, swearing that his vaccine cured HIV.Their gambit worked. Based upon his testimony, Congress appropriated $20 million to the military to support Redfield and Birx’s research project. Public Citizen complained in a 1994 letter to the Congressional Committee’s Henry Waxman that the money caused the Army to kill the investigation and “whitewash” Redfield’s crimes. The fraud propelled Birx and Redfield into stellar careers as health officials.",0
"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. wrote last week about Malibu police’s ticketing Point Dume surfers $1,000 apiece for using the ocean during the quarantine. Was this merely an appalling police judgment at which we will laugh post-quarantine? Or does anyone else feel that this is the first wave of compliance and obedience training for something more permanent? Are powerful state and corporate entities using the current crisis to remove basic rights, and intensify pressures to promote vaccines and surveillance? Does anyone else feel the suffocating darkness of tyranny descending on our nation? And finally, does anyone share my dread that Bill Gates—and his long-time associate Tony Fauci—will somehow be running our Brave New World?Imagine a world where the government doesn’t need police officers to apprehend those surfers or ticket you when you violate social distancing with your girlfriend. Suppose that computers discover your beach trip by tracking your movements using a stream of information from your cell phone, your car, your GPS, facial recognition technology integrated with real-time surveillance from satellites, mounted cameras, and implanted chips. Desk-bound prosecutors or robots will notify you of your violation by text while simultaneously withdrawing your $1,000 penalty in cryptocurrency from your payroll account. Welcome to Bill Gates’ America. It’s right around the corner.5G Strategies. Recently, Bill Gates announced his financial support for a $1 billion plan to blanket Earth in video surveillance satellites.  The company, EarthNow, will launch 500 satellites to live-stream monitor almost every “corner” of the Earth, providing instantaneous video feedback with only a one-second delay. According to Wikipedia, the company expects its customers to include “governments and large enterprises.” 5G Antennas­­­ deploying a vast array of ground-based 5G spy antennas. Through his Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates purchased 5.3 million Crown Castle shares currently worth a billion dollars. The Foundation’s second-largest tech holding after Microsoft, Crown Castle owns 5G infrastructure in every major U.S. market. It operates and leases more than 40,000 cell towers, 65,000 small cell nodes which are the central infrastructure for 5G and 75,000 route miles of fiber to every major U.S. market that, instead of going to your home, providing you safe, fast, wired internet, has been confiscated to connect 5G cell towers.5G has almost nothing to do with improving your lives; it’s all about controlling your life, marketing products, and harvesting your data for Artificial Intelligence purposes. Data Mining
Big Telecom, Big Data, and Bill Gates are baiting Americans into a digital tyranny-trap with million-dollar TV ads that pretend that their multi trillion-dollar  5G investment is about faster download speeds for video games and movies. But 5G has almost nothing to do with improving your lives; it’s all about controlling your life, marketing products, and harvesting your data for Artificial Intelligence. purposes. The 21st century’s “black gold” is data. 5G is the infrastructure for Gates’ “Internet of Things”—a world where tens of billions of “smart” devices: cell phones, computers, automobiles, garage door openers, Apple watches, baby diapers and even our living bodies—are wirelessly interconnected to enable Big Data to gather and sell our personal information.Gates, Elon Musk, Amazon, Facebook, and Telecom are launching the flagships for the new Gold Rush, a teeming fleet of 50,000 satellites and a network of 2,000,000 ground antennas and cell towers to strip mine data from our smart devices. This microwave radiation-emitting spider web will allow Big Data/Big Telecom and Big Brother to capture what happens inside and outside every person at every moment of life. Gates will harvest, control, sort, characterize, analyze, and sell millions of terabytes of personal information from smart devices—private health data, medical records, our shopping habits, our biometric and behavioral responses to advertising, our children’s ability to learn, our facial expressions, and conversations overheard by Siri, Alexa, and your open cell phone’s microphones. His and other corporations will use these analytics to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) and turn you into a predictable, easily-manipulated consuming machine.
Next time you buy a “smart” device, remember the device is not the product—you are.Surveillance State & Transhumanism
Corporations will use Gates’ 5G surveillance system to sell products and escalate AI capacity. Governments will use it to transition the globe to a totalitarian singularity more despotic than Orwell ever imagined. Silicon Valley titans like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Google’s Chief Engineer Ray Kurzweil talk longingly of “transhumanism,” the process by which humanity will transition to become part-human, part-machine via genetic engineering and surgical implants.
Bill Gates is investing heavily to accelerate this altered reality. His ambition to tag us all with injected subdermal vaccine data chips seems to be merely a steppingstone toward an all-encompassing surveillance state.Rewarding Compliance. Microsoft has patented a sinister technology that utilizes implanted sensors to monitor body and brain activity. It will reward compliant humans with crypto currency payments when they perform assigned activities.The Patent, WO |2020| 060606 has gained notoriety and the nickname “World Order 2020 666.” Microsoft describes this device as a “Crypto Currency System” and explains that it is “capable of” using body activity data to mine bitcoin in response to compliance with assigned tasks.People who agree to install the Microsoft harmful wireless sensors will receive periodic “duty” smart phone instructions to watch a certain advertisement, listen to a specific song, walk down a specific grocery store aisle, or to take a certain vaccine. This chip will collect data from embedded sensors that monitor brain waves, blood flow, and other body reactions. The system will transfer cryptocurrency into the subject’s account after completion of the assigned task. On the bright side, Microsoft’s dystopian invention should be a welcome source of income for the 40% of Americans put out of work by periodic COVID quarantines, by Musk’s self-driving electronic cars, which also rely on the 5G rollout, and by Artificial Intelligence, including robots. Will Gates sell the data we freely give him to companies that will take away our jobs?Owning Smart Cities. Maintaining and analyzing the data collected by a 5G infrastructure require massive computers housed in major data storage complexes. To keep control of this infrastructure, Bill Gates is building his own “smart city” in Arizona. According to KPNX-TV, he spent $80 million on a 24,800-acre plot near Phoenix with the goal of turning it into a “smart city” where everything is interconnected via a wireless grid, including fleets of autonomous vehicles. The 80,000 residents of Gates’ company town will mainly work in data centers.To consolidate his control over what people hear, learn, and think, Gates bought shares in Liberty Global, one of the largest international television and Internet companies, operating in 30 countries and growing.Controlling Reproduction.Gates will even control your body, your bedroom, your medicine cabinet and even women’s menstrual and ovulation cycles. He invested approximately $18 million in MicroCHIPS, a company that among other chip-based devices, develops birth-control implant chips with wireless on/off switches and chips for drug-delivery that allow a single implant to store and precisely deliver hundreds of therapeutic doses over months or years. The implants will be operated wirelessly by the patient to deliver medication. Knowing of Gates’ missionary zeal for population control, however, some customers might worry that the system could be remotely activated as well.The expansion of the wireless cloud between 2012–2015 was equivalent to adding 4.9 million cars to the roads.Controlling Climate: Geoengineering
Gates’ apparent conviction that God has ordained him to use technology for humanity’s salvation is exemplified in one of his most ambitious projects. Gates is funding Harvard scientists to use Geoengineering to block the sun to reverse global warming and climate change.That project is a template for both hubris, hypocrisy and risk. The massive expansion of wireless use and the 5G wireless grid—for which Gates is a major player—is the most significant contributor to increased energy consumption. The expansion of the wireless cloud between 2012–2015 was equivalent to adding 4.9 million cars to the roads. 5G is expected to exponentially increase energy use by upwards of 170% by 2026. Proposing to use the wireless “smart” grid to combat the carbon footprint with geotechnology is a hare-brained scheme—not a solution for climate change.Cashless Society.To consolidate global control, Gates has declared war on cash, and the COVID-19 lockdowns have provided governments a convenient pretext for scuttling cash as a health hazard. Gates and his foundation are spearheading the global shift from a cash economy towards digital transactions. Gates and Microsoft are perfectly positioned to profit from a digital payments system. By controlling digital transactions (and removing cash), Gates can control and monitor everything commercial that a country and its citizens do.Western financial institutions—Mastercard, PayPal, Visa, eBay, and Citi—have long pushed for a cashless world. Electronic banking allows banks and financial consortiums to levy fees on every transaction.The Digital Economy will allow the Government to monitor and scrutinize every transaction, to freeze digital accounts, and to block “financial flows” to punish disobedience. Operating in a public-private partnership with government, tech billionaires will not only control the nation but will be able to micromanage the worldwide population. Digitized currency is the ultimate instrument of social control. After all, in a cashless society, survival is impossible without access to the digitized economic system. The poor—lacking bank accounts—will suffer disproportionately.Trillionaire Borg.While the lockdown is a cataclysm for the world economy, it is an opportunity for Gates. By purchasing our devalued assets at a penny on the dollar, Gates’ $100 billion might make him the world’s first trillionaire. But the quarantine is also an opportunity to enlarge his power and dominion. Under Gates’ leadership, Microsoft became known as “The Borg” because of his appetite for total market control. Now, Gates seeks to bring all humanity under his boot. His worship of technology and his megalomania threaten our freedoms, our democracy, our biology, our planet, our humanity, and our souls.The microwave radiation used for wireless surveillance of the world is not biologically tolerable, especially for developing children. Thousands of peer-reviewed, published studies abundantly document wireless technology’s profound, adverse, physical effects on humans, animals and plants. Sickness and environmental degradation from wireless technology is already widespread. Big Telecom control of U.S. and global regulatory agencies and media and Gates’ financial control of the World Health Organization have allowed a few billionaires to propagate the patent lie that wireless is safe.Gates’ technological dreams are not biologically sustainable. His Tower of Babel is bound to collapse, with catastrophic impact for lesser humans. It’s time to dismantle the Tower before it’s too late.",0
"For weeks, talking heads have been promoting the liability-free vaccine(s) that will save the world—so Bill Gates and Tony Fauci proclaim—from what Gates has now dubbed “Pandemic I.” As Microsoft News peddles self-congratulatory stories about the Gates Foundation’s reorientation of its priorities to devote “‘total attention’ to the pandemic,” Fauci—making the rounds of talk shows—pledges that a vaccine will make its debut in January 2021. Not to be outdone, the White House has now unveiled “Operation Warp Speed”—a joint pharmaceutical-government-military effort aimed at “substantially shrinking the development time for a vaccine”—and President Trump promises one by the end of the year.Planet-wide COVID-19 vaccination—the overt objective that has all of these players salivating in anticipation—ignores a number of irrefutable obstacles. For one, the RNA virus being targeted, SARS-CoV-2, already “has mutated into at least 30 different genetic variants.” The variants include 19 never seen before as well as “rare changes that scientists had never imagined could happen.” Knowledge about these mutations may prove useful to clinicians wanting to better tailor their COVID-19 treatments, but the proliferation of mutations makes the chances of developing an effective vaccine immensely more uncertain.Not to worry, say the entities funded by Gates (and also the Pentagon). Scientists working in the burgeoning field of synthetic biology are confident that they can “outdo” and outsmart nature using next-generation vaccine technologies such as gene transfer and self-assembling nanoparticles—along with invasive new vaccine delivery and record-keeping mechanisms such as smartphone-readable quantum dot tattoos. Does it matter that the researchers who have been experimenting with these approaches have never been able to overcome “nasty side effects”? Apparently not. Aided and abetted by the generous Gates and military funding, high-fanfare COVID-19 vaccine planning is proceeding apace.Researchers reiterated this point …  that for most emerging virus vaccines, the main obstacle is not the effectiveness of conventional approaches but the need for more rapid development and large-scale deployment.Speed, not safety
From a manufacturing standpoint, vaccine makers—and particularly those making viral vaccines—have long chafed at the limitations of traditional vaccine technologies, which rely on processes that necessarily entail “a considerable lag time between antigen production and vaccine delivery.” Researchers reiterated this point again in 2018, writing in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery that “for most emerging virus vaccines, the main obstacle is not the effectiveness of conventional approaches but the need for more rapid development and large-scale deployment.”In the 1980s, manufacturers were elated when scientists developed new genetic engineering techniques (recombinant DNA technology) that—through the use of “expression systems” (bacteria, yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells or plants such as tobacco)—made it possible to jumpstart vaccine production and produce so-called “subunit vaccines.” The hepatitis B vaccine was the first to employ this “entirely new” vaccine production approach, and a number of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in the works are deploying these techniques. However, a complicating factor of subunit vaccines is that they must be bundled with “immunopotentiating” adjuvants that tend to trigger an imbalanced immune response.Desirous of streamlining vaccine technology still further and enabling vaccine stockpiles in an even shorter time frame, researchers began tinkering in the mid-1990s with nucleic acid vaccines, which include DNA vaccines and messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. As a form of gene therapy, both represent a significant departure from classical vaccines. Whereas the latter introduce a vaccine antigen to produce an immune response, nucleic acid vaccines instead send the body instructions to produce the antigen itself. As one researcher explains, the nucleic acids “cause the cells to make pieces of the virus,” with the goal being that the immune system then “mounts a response to those pieces of the virus.”Researchers quickly learned that both the DNA and mRNA vaccine options have serious downsides, and as a result, vaccines of this type have never been licensed. Nonetheless, almost one-fourth (20/83) of the vaccines listed by the World Health Organization as COVID-19 “candidate vaccines” as of April 23—including two of the leading contenders—are DNA (Inovio) or mRNA (Moderna) vaccines (see table).DNA vaccines, by definition, come with the risk of integration of exogenous DNA into the host genome, which may cause severe mutagenesis and induced new diseases.DNA vaccines
DNA vaccines are intended to penetrate all the way into a cell’s nucleus. According to one biotech scientist, “This is an incredibly difficult task given that our nuclei have evolved to prevent any foreign DNA from entering (Think viruses!).” Not surprisingly, then, when some DNA vaccines made it into clinical trials in the late 2000s, they were plagued by “suboptimal potency.” Scientists then came up with the idea of solving this problem by augmenting vaccine delivery with “electroporation”—electric shocks applied to the vaccine site (using a “smart device”) to make cell membranes more permeable and force the DNA into the cells. The improvements in vaccine efficacy were significant enough that electroporation remains a key design feature of some COVID-19 vaccine candidates today, including the Moderna vaccine that is now speeding toward Phase 2 clinical trials.A second aspect of DNA vaccines—their gene-altering properties—is even more troubling and remains unresolved. DNA vaccines, by definition, come with the risk of “integration of exogenous DNA into the host genome, which may cause severe mutagenesis and induced new diseases.” Framed in more understandable terms, “disruption from DNA is like inserting a foreign ingredient in an existing recipe, which can change the resulting dish.” The permanent incorporation of synthetic genes into the recipient’s DNA essentially produces a genetically modified human being, with unknown long-term effects. Speaking of DNA gene therapy, one researcher has stated, “Genetic integrations using viral gene therapies . . . can have a devastating effect if the integration was placed in the wrong spot in [the] genome.” Discussing DNA vaccines specifically, the Harvard College Global Health Review elaborates:mRNA vaccines. Because mRNA vaccines are “particularly suited to speedy development,” it is perhaps unsurprising that they are attracting attention as the “coronavirus frontrunners.” mRNA vaccines can reportedly generate savings of “months or years to standardize and ramp up . . . mass production.” Making lemonade out of lemons, insiders casually state that “while no mRNA vaccine has ever been licensed, the threat of a pandemic is a great incentive to accelerate their progress.”
Companies are enamored of the mRNA approach despite observations that the large mRNA molecules are “intrinsically unstable,” “prone to degradation” and may overactivate the immune system. On the plus side, from vaccine scientists’standpoint, mRNA vaccines need only reach the cell cytoplasm rather than the nucleus—an apparently “simpler technical challenge”—although the approach still demands “delivery technologies that can ensure stabilization of mRNA under physiological conditions.” Formulations such as Moderna’s mRNA-1273 vaccine tackle these challenges by using “chemical modifications to stabilize the mRNA” and liquid nanoparticles to “package it into an injectable form.”mRNA approaches seem to attract researchers with a highly mechanistic view of human beings. One such individual praises mRNA for its “inherent ‘programmability,” stating “Much like [a] computer [operating system], mRNA therapy can reprogram [one’s] body to produce its own therapies” [emphasis in original]. The CEO of Moderna describes mRNA approaches—which use “custom-built” strands of mRNA to “turn the body’s cells into ad hoc drug factories”—as being “like software: You can just turn the crank and get a lot of products going into development.” Likewise, the journal Nature (commenting on mRNA technology from “a biotech and industrial perspective”) enthuses that the approach “allows rapid refinement with almost limitless combinations of derivatives.”
Vaccine researchers familiar with both DNA and mRNA vaccines like to play up mRNA vaccine safety, citing the fact that the vaccines do not have to penetrate the cell nucleus. However, with years of mRNA vaccine experimentation behind them, none of these researchers has yet achieved licensure. Why? One answer may be that in preclinical studies, mRNA vaccines have displayed an “intrinsic” inflammatory component that makes it difficult to establish an “acceptable risk/benefit profile.” mRNA enthusiasts admit that there is, as yet, an inadequate understanding of the inflammation and autoimmune reactions that may result. This raises many questions about what will happen if regulators grant the manufacturers of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines their wish for “a fast-track process to get mRNA vaccines to people sooner.”Racing toward profits.The hijacking of nearly all economic, social, artistic and religious activity by SARS-CoV-2 is disturbing on many levels, not least because of what it reveals about the public’s uncritical acceptance of official spin and its yearning for medical silver bullets. As a vaccine researcher at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute has stated:The rush to develop gene-tampering COVID-19 vaccines is also accelerating the conjoined-twins fusion of pharma and biotech. The lucrative biopharma sector is now the fastest-growing segment of the global drug industry, currently representing 20% of the worldwide market and displaying an annual growth rate that is more than double that of conventional pharma. And COVID-19 vaccines are helping rescue some biopharma companies’ shaky bottom lines. In 2017, for example, Moderna was struggling to “keep afloat its brash promise to reinvent medicine” after an experimental therapy that it was counting on proved too unsafe to test in humans. Fast forward to 2020, when “bad news about the coronavirus is good news for Moderna stock.” Other biopharma companies formerly on the skids are likewise poised to make record profits from COVID-19.As biopharma pursues its unfettered, medical-ethics-be-damned race toward a COVID-19 pot of gold, the public needs to take a critical look at the industry’s disincentives for safety and also take a firm stand against the horrifying prospect of coronavirus vaccine mandates. Otherwise, genetically engineered COVID-19 vaccines are likely to start permanently altering genes, triggering autoimmunity and serving as the catalyst for other vaccine injuries or deaths, and—unhampered by any legal liability—none of the commercial or government actors responsible will likely care.",0
"Understanding the origins of coronavirus is vitally important to developing effective treatments and mitigation strategies as well as figuring out how to prevent future pandemics. Many Americans look to the National Institutes of Health and other federal public health agencies for leadership on investigating matters of urgent public health concern. Unfortunately, NIH Director Francis Collins once again appears to be circling the wagons to protect powerful interests rather than the American public. We can and must demand more accountability from government during this perilous time.But their arguments ignore key research findings in their field that contradict their conclusions.Background.The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Nobel Prize winner Luc Montagnier, Professor Stuart Newman, Dr. Michael Antoniou, and others have raised troubling questions about the origins of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). We know that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was engaged in dangerous gain-of-function research involving coronaviruses from bats. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing expressed grave concerns about the shoddy safety practices at the lab. In spite of these concerns, the NIH continued to fund this research.This creates a potential political problem for NIH Director Francis Collins and NIAID Director Anthony Fauci who oversaw these research grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.In response, five NIH grantees quickly published a letter in Nature Medicine (Andersen et al. 2020) arguing that the Wuhan Institute of Virology could not possibly have been the source of the outbreak. NIH Director Collins followed up on his blog to endorse their conclusions. We have seen this pattern before: in response to even the mildest evidence-based criticism, public health agencies in the United State often go to great lengths to deny the allegations and block any further investigation into the matter.But their arguments ignore key research findings in their field that contradict their conclusions. Furthermore, Andersen et al. (2020) and Collins (2020) fail basic tests of logic and common sense and go against a growing body of evidence regarding what we know about the actions of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
An unlikely choice?Andersen et al.’s (2020) argument hinges on two premises: 1.) that the receptor binding domain in the coronavirus spike protein is “not ideal” according to previous computer modeling; and 2.) “genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone” (p. 450).
Professor Stuart Newman editor-in-chief of the journal Biological Theory contests both of these points. He argues that “genetic engineering of one of these sites, the ACE2 receptor binding domain, has been proposed since 2005 in order to help generate vaccines against these viruses (see this paper).” He continues, “It is puzzling that the authors of the Nature Medicine commentary did not cite this paper, which appeared in the prominent journal Science.”Furthermore, “The second site that Andersen et al. assert arose by natural means, a target of enzyme cleavage not usually found in this class of viruses, was in fact introduced by genetic engineering in a similar coronavirus in a [2006] paper they do cite. This was done to explore mechanisms of pathogenicity.”It should be noted that independent researcher James Lyons-Weiler from the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge has also conducted his own analysis of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and concluded that it is most likely from natural origins. So, there is clearly a lot of room for debate.It is troubling that NIH Director Collins would attempt to claim that the case is closed when in fact the research into the origins of coronavirus has only just begun.
The mainstream keeps changing its story.First coronavirus was said to come from bats. Then it was said to come from pangolins. Andersen et al. (2020) is saying ‘it could be bats, it could be pangolins, but whatever it was, it wasn’t the lab.’ The only scientifically correct way to express that idea is to state, “we don’t know.”Andersen et al. (2020) does not say what Dr. Collins claims it says: Andersen et al. (2020) contains these qualifiers: “…it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here.” (p. 452). “More scientific data could swing the balance of evidence to favor one hypothesis over another.” (p. 452) It is troubling that NIH Director Collins would attempt to claim that the case is closed when in fact the research into the origins of coronavirus has only just begun.
Andersen et al. and NHI Director Collins make extraordinary claims to know inside the minds of the researchers in Wuhan: Andersen et al. (2020) repeatedly make “arguments from absence.” In trying to knock down competing explanations, twice they write that a certain action, “has not been described” [in the published literature from this lab]. There are probably LOTS of things that happen inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology that are never disclosed in published articles from the researchers at that lab (and many of the actions that have been described are troubling).Dr. Collins claims that, “any bioengineer trying to design a coronavirus that threatened human health probably would never have chosen this particular conformation for a spike protein.” Is Dr. Collins a mind reader who knows exactly how every bioengineer thinks and acts at all times? Dr. Collins is engaged in conjecture here that is not supported by any evidence gathering.ain-of-function research involves enhancing the host range, virulence, or transmissibility of a pathogen for the purposes of developing treatments, vaccines, or in some cases, bioweapons.What we actually DO know 
Wuhan Institute of Virology was involved in dangerous gain-of-function research: The Wuhan Institute of Virology was engaged in gain-of-function research involving bat viruses. One contract for $3.7 million ran from 2014 to 2019 and another $3.7 million contract ran from 2019 until it was cancelled on April 24, 2020 in response to public outcry.Gain-of-function research involves enhancing the “host range, virulence, or transmissibility of a pathogen” for the purposes of developing treatments, vaccines, or in some cases, bioweapons. This, of course, opens a Pandora’s box of practical, policy, and ethical questions.One type of gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology involved passing viruses through several generations of animal cells. Given that, it is impossible to know whether the change in the virus came from the interaction of a virus and animal cells in the wild or the interaction of a virus and animal cells in the lab.Wuhan Institute of Virology was using CRISPR-Cas9 technology:CRISPR-Cas9 is another technology used for gain-of-function research and it is used by the Wuhan Institute of Virology. CRISPR-Cas9 does for genetics what Microsoft Word did for word processing — it enables geneticists to cut, paste, rearrange, and copy genes however they wish. These are not theoretical genetic structures on paper; CRISPR-Cas9 enables scientists to manipulate actual genetic material in the real world however they wish. Since it is possible to produce literally any genetic sequence in the lab, Collins’ (2020) insistence on natural origins is contrary to what he knows about the possibilities and dangers within his own field. they combined a SARS-like virus from bats with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and created a chimera virus capable of infecting human cells.Several troubling studies out of Wuhan:In 2007 the Wuhan Institute of Virology published a study in the Journal of Virology in which they combined a SARS-like virus from bats with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and created a chimera virus capable of infecting human cells.In 2015, researchers from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, the FDA, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology published research in which they took a bat virus similar to SARS, constructed a chimera virus that could infect mice, discovered that the virus was also capable of infecting “human airway cells,” and found that existing treatments for SARS were ineffective in preventing or killing this new virus. The study was so alarming to many in the scientific community that it set off a fierce debate about medical research ethics that continues to this day. Project Evidence provides links to (and summaries of) six additional studies from the Wuhan Institute of Virology that raise troubling health, safety, and ethical issues.The Wuhan Institute of Virology was known for shoddy safety practices:A March 27, 2020 report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency concluded that it is possible that the new coronavirus emerged “accidentally” due to “unsafe laboratory practices.”According to reporting from The Washington Post:In short, reports from American experts on the ground in China paint a very different picture of the situation than the rosy view coming from NIH Director Collins in Washington D.C.We must demand a full investigation. The Wuhan Institute of Virology was involved in dangerous research to make bat viruses more lethal to humans via passage through animals and manipulation via CRISPR-Cas9; several studies conducted by the lab “successfully” combined animal and human virus traits in ways that made them more dangerous to humans and raised troubling ethical and safety questions; and the Wuhan Institute of Virology was known for its shoddy laboratory practices. This was a recipe for disaster. We must get to the bottom of this matter. The White House and Congress should immediately appoint an independent safety commission with no financial conflicts of interest to investigate the origins of SARS-CoV-2.",0

"A group of medical doctors, healthcare providers and scientists met online March 17, 2020, to discuss the use of high dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) in the treatment of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 patients. The key guest was Dr. Enqian Mao, chief of emergency medicine department at Ruijin Hospital, a major hospital in Shanghai, affiliated with the Joatong University College of Medicine. Dr. Mao is also a member of the Senior Expert Team at the Shanghai Public Health Center, where all Covid-19 patients have been treated. In addition, Dr. Mao co-authored the Shanghhai Guidelines for the Treatment of Covid-19 Infection, an official document endorsed by the Shanghai Medical Association and the Shanghai city government.Dr. Mao has been using high-dose dose IVC to treat patients with acute pancreatitis, sepsis, surgical wound healing and other medical conditions for over 10 years. When Covid-19 broke out, he and other experts thought of vitamin C and recommended IVC for the treatment of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 patients. The recommendation was accepted early in the epidemic by the Shanghai Expert Team. All serious or critically ill Covid-19 patients in the Shanghai area were treated in Shanghai Public Health Center, for a total of 358 Covid-19 patients as of March 17th, 2020.Dr. Mao stated that his group treated ~50 cases of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 infection with high dose IVC. The IVC dosing was in the range of 10,000 mg - 20,000 mg a day for 7-10 days, with 10,000 mg for moderate cases and 20,000 for more severe cases, determined by pulmonary status (mostly the oxygenation index) and coagulation status. All patients who received IVC improved and there was no mortality. Compared to the average of a 30-day hospital stay for all Covid-19 patients, those patients who received high dose IVC had a hospital stay about 3-5 days shorter than the overall patients. Dr. Mao discussed one severe case in particular who was deteriorating rapidly. He gave a bolus of 50,000 mg IVC over a period of 4 hours. The patient's pulmonary (oxygenation index) status stabilized and improved as the critical care team watched in real time. There were no side effects reported from any of the cases treated with high dose IVC.
Among the international experts who attended today's video conference were: Dr. Atsuo Yanagisawa, formerly professor of medicine at the Kyorin University, Tokyo, Japan, and the president of the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine; Dr. Jun Matsuyama of Japan; Dr. Michael J Gonzalez, professor at University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences, Dr. Jean Drisko, professor of medicine, and Dr. Qi Chen, professor of pharmacology, both at the Kansas University Medical School, Dr. Alpha ""Berry"" Fowler, professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Dr. Maurice Beer and Asa Kitfield, both from NutriDrip and Integrative Medical NY, New York City; Dr. Hong Zhang of Beijing; William T. Penberthy, PhD of CME Scribe, Florida; Ilyes Baghli, MD, president of the Algerian Society of Nutrition and Orthomolecular Medicine (SANMO); Drs. Mignonne Mary and Charles Mary Jr, of the Remedy Room, New Orleans; Dr. Selvam Rengasamy, president of SAHAMM, Malaysia. I, Richard Cheng, MD, PhD of Cheng Integrative Health Center of South Carolina, and Senior Advisor to ShenZhen Medical Association and Shenzhen BaoAn Central Hospital, coordinated this conference.Albeit a brief meeting of less than 45 minutes due to Dr. Mao's limited time availability, the audience thanked Dr. Mao for his time and sharing and wished to keep the communication channel open and also able to talk to other clinicians working at the front line against Covid-19.In a separate meeting, I had the honor to talk to Sheng Wang, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Critical Care Medicine of Shanghai 10th Hospital, Tongji University College of Medicine at Shanghai China, who also served at the Senior Clinical Expert Team of the Shanghai Covid-19 Control and Prevention Team. There are three lessons that we learned about this Covid-19 infection, Dr. Wang said:Early and high-dose IVC is quite helpful in helping Covid-19 patients. The data is still being finalized and the formal papers will be submitted for publication as soon as they are complete.Covid-19 patients appear to have a high rate of hyper-coagulability. Among the severe cases, ~40% severe cases showed hyper-coagulability, whereas the number among the mild to moderate cases were 15-20%. Heparin was used among those with coagulation issues.The third important lesson learned is the importance for the healthcare team of gearing up to wear protective clothing at the earliest opportunity for intubation and other emergency rescue measures. We found that if we waited until a patient developed the full-blown signs for intubation, then got ready to intubate, we would lose the precious minutes. So the treatment team should lower the threshold for intubation, to allow proper time (~15 minutes or so) for the team to gear up. This critical 15-30 minutes could make a difference in the outcome.Also, both Drs. Mao and Wang confirmed that there are other medical teams in other parts of the country who have been using high dose IVC treating Covid-19 patients.For additional reporting and information on China's successful use of intravenous vitamin C against COVID-19",0
"Ms. N lives in Wuhan, China. She takes special care about the well-being of her entire family including her chronically-ill mother, aged 71. Ms. N has always been interested in nutrition and she recently learned about vitamin C's antiviral effects.I am an American physician currently residing in Shanghai. I interviewed Ms. N by telephone after I received a forwarded story that she posted on Chinese social media, WeChat. I made an effort to connect with Ms. N to verify the story and below is what she told me.Ms. N lives with her child in the epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic. She is close to her parents and her brother and his wife. The six of them visit each other on a regular basis. Her mother has diabetes and heart disease with stents placed, in addition to several other chronic illnesses including reflux esophagitis.
Right before the Chinese New Year, around January 21st, her mother developed flu-like symptoms, with a low grade fever of 38C. Based on her knowledge. Ms. N advised all members of the family to take oral vitamin C. She herself has been taking about 20,000 mg daily in divided-up doses. Her mother reluctantly took a smaller dose, probably half or less of what her daughter's been taking.Her mother's condition was stable for 9-10 days. But on January 30th, without deteriorating, her mother decided to go to Wuhan Union Hospital, Tongji College of Medicine, The Science and Technology University of Central China, a hospital prominent not only in Wuhan, but in all of China. She wanted to check out if she was infected with the Wuhan pneumonia virus. She got her presumption confirmed. At the hospital, she was diagnosed of what became known now as Covid-19 pneumonia. The second day upon admission, her fever started going up, as high as 39.6C. In about 10 days on February 10th she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and went on the heart-lung machine as a final attempt to save her life.At this time Ms. N learned of the clinical trials with vitamin C, administered by infusion (IVC; intravenous vitamin C). Immediately she requested the person in charge on the ICU to use large dose IVC on her mother. The attending physician agreed but would go only to around 10,000 mg. So it happened. After 20 days in ICU, her mother improved and was discharged to a regular ward a few days ago, continuing the IVC treatment, as insisted by Ms. N.While in hospital, Miss N, her brother and sister-in-law took turns to visit and take care of her mother. They were wearing very simple protection: gloves and masks. Also noted is that while her mother got sick at home, none of the five other family members was wearing any mask for several days. But all of them went on oral vitamin C tablets. None of them developed COVID-19 infection.So far this is the story of Ms. N. We wish her mother a full and rapid recovery.In the context of the vast amount of research, clinical studies, case reports and my own decades of experience on vitamin C's use on viral infections, I summarize the story below with a few take-home messages:Vitamin C tablets at high doses daily may be the reason why the family didn't catch the infection.Given her age, history of chronic disease, and the high mortality of COVID-19 on seniors, IVC may have played a large role in her mother's improvement.The news of official IVC clinical trials has definitely had a positive impact in this case, as the attending physician was emboldened to use IVC. A well-functioning immune system is of the utmost importance to keep away the viral infection. And, vitamin C may support the defense against the COVID-19 virus, most importantly in chronically ill patients with a weakened immune system.(Note from Andrew W. Saul, OMNS Editor-in-Chief: Dr. Richard Cheng is still in China now. He continues to work overtime with expert Chinese doctors and hospitals to facilitate providing intravenous vitamin C for the most seriously ill COVID-19 victims. For background information on the plausibility of treating coronavirus with high-dose vitamin C",0
"The government of Shanghai, China has announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of intravenous vitamin C. (1) Dosage recommendations vary with severity of illness, from 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 200 mg/kg/day.These dosages are approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mg for an adult, administered by IV. This specific method of administration is important, says intravenous therapy expert Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD, because vitamin C's effect is at least ten times more powerful by IV than if taken orally. Dr. Yanagisawa is president of the Tokyo-based Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy. He says, ""Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.""Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, a Chinese-American specialist physician, has been working closely with medical and governmental authorities throughout China. He has been instrumental in facilitating at least three Chinese clinical IV vitamin C studies now underway. Dr. Cheng is presently in Shanghai continuing his efforts to encourage still more Chinese hospitals to implement vitamin C therapy incorporating high oral doses as well as C by IV.Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa both recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19 infection.An official statement from Xi'an Jiaotong University Second Hospital (2) reads:""On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).""",0
"First of all, the naysayers are too late. Vitamin C is already being used to prevent and treat COVID-19 in China and in Korea. And it is working.Here is a verified official statement from China's Xi'an Jiaotong University Second Hospital:""On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe coronavirus pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia, and for critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. High-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).""Here is a report from Korea:""At my hospital in Daegu, South Korea, all inpatients and all staff members have been using vitamin C orally since last week. Some people this week had a mild fever, headaches and coughs, and those who had symptoms got 30,000 mg intravenous vitamin C. Some people got better after about two days, and most had symptoms go away after one injection.""There are at least three high-dose intravenous vitamin C studies underway in China. Literally by the truckload, tons of vitamin C has been sent into Wuhan.Here is a report from a physician in China:""We need to broadcast a message worldwide very quickly: Vitamin C (small or large dose) does no harm to people and is the one of the few, if not the only, agent that has a chance to prevent us from getting, and can treat, COVID-19 infection. When can we, medical doctors and scientists, put patients' lives first?"" (Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, International Vitamin C China Epidemic Medical Support Team Leader).News media attacks on vitamin C are centered on 0 allegations of dangers with megadoses. This tactic lets the media ignore the truth that even LOW doses of vitamin C reduce symptoms and death rates. Do not let the media spin this issue. Advocates of vitamin C are medical doctors, not spin doctors. They are experienced, credentialed clinicians who have read the science, a small sample of which follows.Even small supplemental amounts of vitamin C can keep severely ill patients from dying.Infants with viral pneumonia treated with vitamin C had reduced mortality.17,000 mg/day vitamin C given intravenously shortened intensive care unit stay by 44%.200 mg of vitamin C reduced duration of severe pneumonia in children. Oxygen saturation was improved in less than one day.The Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, and its editorial board of nearly four dozen physicians, academics and health professionals (listed below) feel it is necessary to report on what the advertiser-supported, corporate-controlled commercial media refuses to acknowledge: even small amounts of vitamin C dramatically decrease severity of symptoms, and increase survival rates, among severely ill viral patients. Large doses work better. Intravenous large doses work better still. OMNS has been relentlessly reporting on this for weeks",0
"There is only one existing treatment for the new coronavirus: vitamin C.Vitamin C supports your immune system.Vitamin C helps to kill the virus and reduces the symptoms of infection.It's not a COVID ""cure,"" but nothing is.It might just save your life, though, and will definitely reduce the severity of the infection.If someone tells you it's not proven, consider two things:Nothing is proven to work against COVID-19, because it is a new virus.Vitamin C has worked against every single virus including influenzas, pneumonia, and even poliomyelitis.What to do.If you do nothing else, start taking vitamin C right away; at least 3 grams a day, spread right across the day. That's a 1,000 milligram capsule every 8 hours, or a level teaspoon of powder dissolved in a pint or so of water, drank all through the day.If you're smart and motivated, do all the other things recommended in our previous release Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus (http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n04.shtml).When and if you catch a bug that might be COVID-19, simply increase your vitamin C intake: a rounded teaspoon (that's 4 to 5 grams) in water (which helps to keep you hydrated) every 3 or 4 hours. And keep on taking it.Do you consult a doctor? Do you self-isolate? Yes and yes. Of course you do; that's your duty to others.Vitamin C and the other measures are what you do for yourself.These links provide a large number of references to back up our above statements",0
"Intravenous vitamin C is already being employed in China against COVID-19 coronavirus. I am receiving regular updates because I am part of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Board to the International Intravenous Vitamin C China Epidemic Medical Support Team.Direct report from China
OMNS Chinese edition editor Dr. Richard Cheng is reporting from China about the first approved study of 12,000 to 24,000 mg/day of vitamin C by IV. The doctor also specifically calls for immediate use of vitamin C for prevention of coronavirus (COVID-19). A second clinical trial of intravenous vitamin C was announced in China on Feb. 13th. In this second study, says Dr. Cheng, ""They plan to give 6,000 mg/day and 12,000 mg/day per day for moderate and severe cases. We are also communicating with other hospitals about starting more intravenous vitamin C clinical studies. We would like to see oral vitamin C included in these studies, as the oral forms can be applied to more patients and at home."" And on Feb 21, 2020, announcement has been made of a third research trial now approved for intravenous vitamin C for COVID-19. Dr. Cheng, who is a US board-certified specialist in anti-aging medicine, adds: ""Vitamin C is very promising for prevention, and especially important to treat dying patients when there is no better treatment. Over 2,000 people have died of the COIV-19 outbreak and yet I have not seen or heard large dose intravenous vitamin C being used in any of the cases. The current sole focus on vaccine and specific antiviral drugs for epidemics is misplaced.""
He adds that: ""Early and sufficiently large doses of intravenous vitamin C are critical. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant, but also involved in virus killing and prevention of viral replication. The significance of large dose intravenous vitamin C is not just at antiviral level. It is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that kills most people from coronaviral pandemics (SARS, MERS and now NCP). ARDS is a common final pathway leading to death.""We therefore call for a worldwide discussion and debate on this topic.""News of vitamin C research for COVID-19 is being actively suppressed
Anyone saying that vitamin therapy can stop coronavirus is already being labeled as ""promoting 0 information"" and promulgating ""fake news."" Even the sharing of verifiable news, and direct quotes from credentialed medical professionals, is being restricted or blocked on social media. You can see sequential examples of this phenomenon at my Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/themegavitaminman. Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) has, literally, met with Google and Facebook and other media giants to stop the spread of what they declare to be wrong information.Physician-directed, hospital-based administration of intravenous vitamin C has been marginalized or discredited. Scientific debate over COVID-19 appears to not be allowed.Ironically, Facebook, blocking any significant users' sharing of the news of approved vitamin therapy research, is itself blocked in China by the Chinese government. As for the internet, yes, China has it. And yes, it is censored. But, significantly, the Chinese government has not blocked this real news on how intravenous vitamin C will save lives in the COVID-19 epidemic. Here is the protocol as published in Chinese. Medical orthodoxy obsessively focuses on searching for a vaccine and/or drug for coronavirus COVID-19). While they are looking for what would be fabulously profitable approaches, we have with vitamin C an existing, plausible, clinically demonstrated method to treat what coronavirus patients die from: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or pneumonia.And it is available right now.To read all Orthomolecular Medicine News Service Reports on COVID coronavirus and intravenous vitamin C",0
"The coronavirus pandemic can be dramatically slowed, or stopped, with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C. Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular.It is very important to maximize the body's anti-oxidative capacity and natural immunity to prevent and minimize symptoms when a virus attacks the human body. The host environment is crucial. Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness. But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.""I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.""The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight:Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams (or more) daily, in divided doses.Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. (Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000). Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form). Zinc: 20 mg daily. Selenium: 100 mcg (micrograms) daily. Vitamin C, Vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, and selenium have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.The basis for using high doses of vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to vitamin C's early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940s.[6] Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this. Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980.It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory infections with large amounts of vitamin C is well established. Those who believe that vitamin C generally has merit, but massive doses are ineffective or somehow harmful, will do well to read the original papers for themselves. To dismiss the work of these doctors simply because they had success so long ago sidesteps a more important question: Why has the benefit of their clinical experience not been presented to the public by responsible governmental authorities, especially in the face of a viral pandemic?",0
"Abundant clinical evidence confirms vitamin C's powerful antiviral effect when used in sufficient quantity. Treating influenza with very large amounts of vitamin C is not a new idea at all. Frederick R. Klenner, MD, and Robert F. Cathcart, MD, successfully used this approach for decades. Frequent oral dosing with vitamin C sufficient to reach a daily bowel tolerance limit will work for most persons. Intravenous vitamin C is indicated for the most serious cases.Bowel tolerance levels of vitamin C, taken as divided doses all throughout the day, are a clinically proven antiviral without equal. Vitamin C can be used alone or right along with medicines if one so chooses.""Some physicians would stand by and see their patients die rather than use ascorbic acid. Vitamin C should be given to the patient while the doctors ponder the diagnosis.""Dr. Robert Cathcart advocated treating influenza with up to 150,000 milligrams of vitamin C daily, often intravenously. You and I can, to some extent, simulate a 24 hour IV of vitamin C by taking it by mouth very, very often. When I had pneumonia, it took 2,000 mg of vitamin C every six minutes, by the clock, to get me to saturation. My oral daily dose was over 100,000 mg. Fever, cough and other symptoms were reduced in hours; complete recovery took just a few days. That is performance at least as good as any pharmaceutical will give, and the vitamin is both safer and cheaper. Many physicians consider high doses of vitamin C to be so powerful an antiviral that it may be ranked as a functional immunization for a variety influenza strains. Dr. Cathcart writes:""The sicker a person was, the more ascorbic acid they would tolerate orally without it causing diarrhea. In a person with an otherwise normal GI tract when they were well, would tolerate 5 to 15 grams of ascorbic acid orally in divided doses without diarrhea. With a mild cold 30 to 60 grams; with a bad cold, 100 grams; with a flu, 150 grams; and with mononucleosis, viral pneumonia, etc. 200 grams or more of ascorbic acid would be tolerated orally without diarrhea. The process of finding what dose will cause diarrhea and will eliminate the acute symptoms, I call titrating to bowel tolerance.""The ascorbate effect is a threshold effect. Symptoms are usually neutralized when a dose of about 90% or more of bowel tolerance is reached with oral ascorbic acid. Intravenous sodium ascorbate is about 2½ times more powerful than ascorbic acid by mouth and since for all practical purposes huge doses of sodium ascorbate are non-toxic, whatever dose necessary to eliminate free radical driven symptoms should be given.""The coronavirus, in acute infections, may be expected to be just as susceptible to vitamin C as all of the other viruses against which it has been proven to be extremely effective. There has never been a documented situation in which sufficiently high dosing with vitamin C has been unable to neutralize or kill any virus against which it has been tested.Even the common cold is a coronavirus. A ""new"" opportunistic virus is a not a big surprise. History is full of them.Flu Pandemic of 1919-1920.About 10 million soldiers were killed in World War I (1914-1918), charging machine guns and getting mowed down month after month. There were nearly a million casualties at the Somme and another million at Verdun. A terrible slaughter went on for four years. Yet, in just the two years following the war, over 20 million people died from influenza. That is more than twice as many deaths from the flu in one-half the time it took the machine guns.With a century's worth of accumulated scientific hindsight, we must today ask this: Was a lack of vaccinations really the cause of those flu deaths, or was it really wartime stress, and especially war-induced malnutrition, that set the stage in 1918? And now, once again, we have an alarming and rather similar scenario: between nutrient-poor processed convenience foods, McNothing meals and TV news scare stories, we have the basic ingredients for an epidemic.Influenza is a serious disease, and historically, has been the Reaper's scythe. There is no way to make light of that. It warrants a closer look at how the medical profession and government have approached different types of influenza.Swine Flu.In the mid-1970s, there was the colossal Swine Flu panic. Here is what the government of the United States said about the infamous Swine Flu vaccine, in a 1976 mass-distributed FDA Consumer Memo on the subject:""Some minor side effects - tenderness in the arm, low fever, tiredness - will occur in less than 4% of (vaccinated) adults. Serious reactions from flu vaccines are very rare.""Many will remember the very numerous and very serious side effects of Swine Flu vaccine that forced the federal immunization program to a halt. So much for blanket claims of safety.As far as being essential, in the same memo the FDA said this of the same vaccine:""Question: What can be done to prevent an epidemic? Answer: The only preventive action we can take is to develop a vaccine to immunize the public against the virus. This will prevent the virus from spreading.""This was seen to be totally 0. The public immunization program for Swine Flu was abruptly halted and still there was no epidemic. If vaccination were the only defense, one might expect that tens of millions of Americans would have been struck down with the Swine Flu, for a large percentage of the population of the U.S. was not vaccinated.""Vaccines are being used as an ideological weapon. What you see every year as the flu is caused by 200 or 300 different agents with a vaccine against two of them. That is simply nonsense."" (Tom Jefferson, MD, epidemiologist).Bird Flu.Robert F. Cathcart, MD, writes: ""Treatment of the Bird Flu with massive doses of ascorbate would be the same as any other flu except that the severity of the disease indicates that it may take unusually massive doses of ascorbic acid orally or even intravenous sodium ascorbate. (Why the dose needed is somewhat proportional to the severity of the disease being treated is discussed in my paper published in 1981, Titrating to Bowel Tolerance, Anascorbemia, and Acute Induced Scurvy.) I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C but it is possible that the bird flu may require even higher doses such as 150 to 300 grams a day. Additionally, this flu could be primarily respiratory. This means that hospitalization might be necessary. If massive doses of ascorbate are not used, they may not be adequate. Most hospitals will not allow adequate doses of ascorbate to be given.""Initial oral doses of ascorbic acid should also be massive. I would suggest like 12 grams every 15 minutes until diarrhea is produced. Then, however, doses should be reduced but not much. Listen to your body. If there are many symptoms, keep taking doses that cause a little diarrhea. You do not want constant runs because it is the amount you absorb that is important, not the amount you put in your mouth.""BBC - 9 April 2006: ""The chances of bird flu virus mutating into a form that spreads between humans are 'very low,' the government's chief scientific adviser has said. Sir David King said any suggestion a global flu pandemic in humans was inevitable was 'totally misleading.'""SARS.The coronavirus outbreak in China seems to be due to a virus similar to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which was also a coronavirus. You may remember SARS from 2002. I most certainly do, as I was in Toronto, Canada at the time, smack in the middle of it. I took a lot of vitamin C preventively and had zero symptoms.""The common cold is a coronavirus, and SARS is a coronavirus, so they are the same viral type."" (David Jenkins, MD, Professor of Medicine and Nutritional Science, University of Toronto).Waiting for a vaccine?""We have set up a situation where a fear is created, and then we try to create the treatment for this fear. The public gets the idea that the flu is going to kill them and the vaccine will save them. Neither is true."" (Marc Siegel, MD, author of 0 Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of Fear).Robert F. Cathcart: ""All this talk about a vaccine is too late; a waste of time now, especially when we know how to cure the disease already. Every flu I have seen so far (since 1970) has been cured or ameliorated by massive doses of ascorbate. All of these diseases kill by way of free radicals. These free radicals are easily eliminated by massive doses of ascorbate. This is a matter of chemistry, not medicine. The time has come to stop hiding our ability to treat these acute infectious diseases with massive doses of ascorbate.""Ideally, however, in serious cases this disease should be treated first with at least 180 grams or more of sodium ascorbate intravenously every 24 hours running constantly until the fever is broken and most of the symptoms are ameliorated. If after a few hours that rate of administration does not have an obvious ameliorating effect, the rate should be increased."" What dosage?Vitamin C fights all types of viruses. Although the dose should truly be high, even a low supplemental amount of vitamin C saves lives. This is very important for those with low incomes and few treatment options. For example, in one well-controlled, randomized study, just 200 mg/day vitamin C given to the elderly resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms in the most severely ill, hospitalized patients. And there were 80% fewer deaths in the vitamin C group.But to best build up our immune systems, we need to employ large, orthomolecular doses of several vital nutrients. The physicians on the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service review board specifically recommend at least 3,000 milligrams (or more) of vitamin C daily, in divided doses. Vitamin C empowers the immune system and can directly denature many viruses. It can be taken as ascorbic acid (which is sour like vinegar), either in capsules or as crystals dissolved in water or juice. It can also be taken as sodium ascorbate, which is non-acidic. To be most effective, it should be taken to bowel tolerance. This means taking high doses several (or many) times each day. See the references below for more information.Nebulized hydrogen peroxide.Thomas E. Levy, MD: ""Viral syndromes start or are strongly supported by ongoing viral replication in the naso- and oropharynx. When appropriate agents are nebulized (into a fine spray) and this viral presence is quickly eliminated, the rest of the body ""mops up"" quite nicely the rest of the viral presence. The worst viral infections are continually fed and sustained by the viral growth in the pharynx. Probably the best and most accessible agent to nebulize would be 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 to 30 minutes several times daily."" An example of successful treatment by ascorbate:""Chikungunya is a viral illness characterized by severe joint pains, which may persist for months to years. There is no effective treatment for this disease. We treated 56 patients with moderate to severe persistent pains with a single infusion of ascorbic acid ranging from 25-50 grams and hydrogen peroxide (3 cc of a 3% solution) from July to October 2014. Patients were asked about their pain using the Verbal Numerical Rating Scale-11 immediately before and after treatment. The mean Pain Score before and after treatment was 8 and 2 respectively (60%) (p < 0.001); and 5 patients (9%) had a Pain Score of 0. The use of intravenous ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide resulted in a statistically significant reduction of pain in patients with moderate to severe pain from the Chikungunya virus immediately after treatment.""Available evidence indicates that supplementation with multiple micronutrients with immune-supporting roles may modulate immune function and reduce the risk of infection. Micronutrients with the strongest evidence for immune support are vitamins C and D and zinc.Additional recommended nutrients.Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form). Many people are deficient in magnesium, because modern agriculture often does not supply adequate magnesium in the soil, and food processing removes magnesium. It is an extremely important nutrient that is essential for hundreds of biochemical pathways. A blood test for magnesium cannot correctly diagnose a deficiency. A long-term deficiency of magnesium can build up in the body that may take 6 months to a year of higher than normal doses to replete.A very cheap and highly beneficial adjunct for any acute infection, especially viral, is oral magnesium chloride. Amazingly, just as intravenous vitamin C has been shown to cure polio, an oral magnesium chloride regimen has been shown to do the same thing, as or even more effectively than the vitamin C.Mix 25 grams MgCl2 in a quart of water. Depending on body size (tiny infant to an adult), give 15 to 125 ml of this solution four times daily. If the taste is too salty/bitter, a favorite juice can be added.Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. (Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000). Vitamin D is stored in the body for long periods but takes a long time to reach an effective level. If you are deficient (e.g. if you haven't taken vitamin D and it's near the end of winter when the sun is low in the sky) you can start by taking larger than normal doses for 2 weeks to build up the level quickly. The maintenance dose varies with body weight, 400-1000 IU/day for children and 2000-5000 IU/day for adults.William Grant, PhD, says: ""Coronaviruses cause pneumonia as does influenza. A study of the case-fatality rate from the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States showed that most deaths were due to pneumonia. The SARS-coronavirus and the current China coronavirus were both most common in winter, when vitamin D status is lowest."" ""I have found the value of bolstering immune function with Vitamin D to be incredibly powerful."" (Dr. Jeffrey Allyn Ruterbusch)Zinc.Zinc is a powerful antioxidant and is essential for many biochemical pathways. It has been shown to be effective in helping the body fight infections. [20,21] A recommended dose is 20-40 mg/day for adults.Selenium: 100 mcg (micrograms) daily. Selenium is an essential nutrient and an important antioxidant that can help to fight infections. Dr. Damien Downing says: ""Swine flu, bird flu and SARS (another coronavirus) all developed in selenium-deficient areas of China; Ebola and HIV in Selenium-deficient areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. This is because the same oxidative stress that causes us inflammation forces viruses to mutate rapidly in order to survive. 'When Se-deficient virus-infected hosts were supplemented with dietary Se, viral mutation rates diminished and immunocompetence improved.'""B-complex vitamins and vitamin A: A multivitamin tablet with each meal will supply these conveniently and economically.Nutritional supplements are not just a good idea. For fighting viruses, they are absolutely essential.",0
"No matter which hospital a coronavirus patient may seek help from, the question is, Will they be able to leave walking out the front door, or end up being wheeled out the basement backdoor? Prompt administration of intravenous vitamin C, in high doses, can make the difference.Abundant clinical evidence confirms vitamin C's effectiveness when used in sufficient quantity.Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades.Specific instructions for intravenous vitamin C.The Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy (JCIT) recommends intravenous vitamin C (IVC) 12.5/25g (12,500 - 25,000 mg) for acute viral infections (influenza, herpes zoster, common cold, rubella, mumps, etc.) and virus mimetic infections (idiopathic sudden hearing loss, Bell's palsy). In adults, IVC 12.5g is given for early stage illness with mild symptoms, and IVC 25g for moderate to severe symptoms. IVC is usually administered once or twice a day for 2-5 continuous days, along with or without general treatments for viral infections.Patients with acute viral infections show a depletion of vitamin C and increasing free radicals and cellular dysfunction. Such patients should be treated with vitamin C, oral or IV, for neutralizing free radicals throughout the body and inside cells, maintaining physiological functions, and enhancing natural healing. If patients progress to sepsis, vitamin C should be added intravenously as soon as possible along with conventional therapy for sepsis.Toronto Star, 30 May 2003: ""Fred Hui, MD believes that administering vitamin C intravenously is a treatment worth trying. And he'd like to see people admitted to hospital for the pneumonia-like virus treated with the vitamin intravenously while also receiving the usual drugs for SARS. 'I appeal to hospitals to try this for people who already have SARS,' says Hui. Members of the public would also do well to build up their levels of vitamin C, he says, adding that there is nothing to lose in trying it. 'This is one of the most harmless substances there is,' Hui states. 'There used to be concern about kidney stones, but that was theoretical. It was never borne out in an actual case.' Hui says he has found intravenous vitamin C effective in his medical practice with patients who have viral illnesses.""Additional administration details are readily obtained from a free download of the complete Riordan Clinic Intravenous Vitamin C Protocol. [4] Although initially prepared for cancer patients, the protocol has found widespread application for many other diseases, particularly viral illnesses.""Research and experience has shown that a therapeutic goal of reaching a peak-plasma concentration of ~20 mM (350- 400 mg/dL) is most efficacious. (No increased toxicity for posoxidant IVC plasma vitamin C levels up to 780 mg/dL has been observed.) . . . [T]he administering physician begins with a series of three consecutive IVC infusions at the 15, 25, and 50 gram dosages followed by post IVC plasma vitamin C levels in order to determine the oxidative burden for that patient so that subsequent IVCs can be optimally dosed.""Given the rapid rate of success of intravenous vitamin C in viral diseases, I strongly believe it would be my first recommendation in the management of corona virus infections. It is of great importance for all doctors to be informed about intravenous vitamin C. When a patient is already in hospital severely ill, this would be the best solution to help save her or his life. Winning the hospital game. When faced with hospitalization, the most powerful person in the most entire hospital system is the patient. However, in most cases, the system works on the assumption that the patient will not claim that power. If on your way in you signed the hospital's legal consent form, you can unsign it. You can revoke your permission. Just because somebody has permission to do one thing doesn't mean that they have the permission to do everything. There's no such thing as a situation that you cannot reverse. You can change your mind about your own personal healthcare. It concerns your very life. The rights of the patient override the rules of any institution.If the patient doesn't know that, or if they're not conscious, or if they just don't have the moxie to do it, the next most powerful person is the spouse. The spouse has enormous influence and can do almost as much as the patient. If the patient is incapacitated, the spouse can, and must, do all the more. If there is no spouse present, the next most powerful people in the system are the children of the patient.When you go to the hospital, bring along a big red pen, and cross out anything that you don't like in the hospital's permission form. And before you sign it, add anything you want. Write out ""I want intravenous vitamin C, 25 grams per day, until I state otherwise."" And should they say, ""We're not going to admit you,"" you reply, ""Please put it in writing that you refuse to admit me."" What do you think their lawyers are going to do with that? They have to admit you. It's a game, and you can win it. But you can't win it if you don't know the rules. And basically, they don't tell you the rules.This is deadly serious. Medical mistakes are now the third leading cause of death in the US. Yes, medical errors kill over 400,000 Americans every year. That's 1,100 each day, every day.There are mistakes of commission and mistakes of omission. Failure to provide intravenous vitamin C is, literally, a grave omission. Do not allow yourself or your loved ones to be deprived of a simple, easy to prepare and administer IV of vitamin C.If a family member of mine died due to coronavirus infection, after a doctor refused to use intravenous vitamin C, I would challenge his or her treatment in a court of law. I would win.It can be done Vitamin IVs can be arranged in virtually any hospital, anywhere in the world. Attorney and cardiologist Thomas E. Levy's very relevant presentation is free access.Both the letter and the intent of new USA legislation now make this easier for you.The new federal Right to Try Act provides patients suffering from life-threatening diseases or conditions the right to use investigational drugs... It amends the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt investigational drugs provided to patients who have exhausted approved treatment options and are unable to participate in a clinical trial involving the drug. Advocates of right to try laws have sought to accelerate access to new drugs for terminally ill patients who are running out of options. Arguably, the law does not represent a radical change in this and several other states, however, because in 2016, California had already joined the majority of other states in adopting a law enabling physicians to help terminally ill patients pursue investigational therapies, without fear of Medical Board or state civil or criminal liability. . . The new Right to Try law should give physicians, as well as drug manufacturers, some added comfort about FDA enforcement in these cases.""Therefore, in regards to intravenous vitamin C, do not accept stories that ""the hospital can't"" or ""the doctor can't"" or that ""the state won't allow it. If you hear any of this malarkey, please send the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service the text of the policy or the law that says so. In the meantime, take the reins and get vitamin C in the veins.",0
"How Vitamin C Reduces Severity and Deaths from Serious Viral Respiratory Diseases. Most deaths from coronavirus are caused by pneumonia. Vitamin C has been known, for over 80 years, to greatly benefit pneumonia patients.In 1936 Gander and Niederberger found that vitamin C lowered fever and reduced pain in pneumonia patients.Also in 1936, Hochwald independently reported similar results. He gave 500 mg of vitamin C every ninety minutes.McCormick gave 1000 mg vitamin C intravenously, followed by 500 mg orally every hour. He repeated the injection at least once. On the fourth day, his patient felt so well that he voluntarily resumed work, with no adverse effects.In 1944 Slotkin and Fletcher reported on the prophylactic and therapeutic value of vitamin C in bronchopneumonia, lung abscess, and purulent bronchitis. ""Vitamin C has greatly alleviated this condition and promptly restored normal pulmonary function.""Slotkin further reported that ""Vitamin C has been used routinely by the general surgeons in the Millard Fillmore Hospital, Buffalo, as a prophylactic against pneumonia, with complete disappearance of this complication.""According to the US Centers for Disease Control, there are about 80,000 dead from annual influenzas, escalating to pneumonia, in the USA. Coronavirus is a very serious contagious disease. But contagion to a virus largely depends on the susceptibility of the host. It is well established that low vitamin C levels increase susceptibility to viruses.Vitamin C lowers mortality. It is one thing to be sick from a virus and another thing entirely to die from a viral-instigated disease. It must be emphasized that a mere 200 mg of vitamin C/day resulted in an 80% decrease in deaths among severely ill, hospitalized respiratory disease patients.A single, cheap, big-box discount store vitamin C tablet will provide more than twice the amount used in the study above.And yes, with vitamin C, more is better.Frederick R. Klenner and Robert F. Cathcart successfully treated influenza and pneumonia with very high doses of vitamin C. Klenner published on his results beginning in the 1940s; [8] Cathcart beginning in the 1970s. They used both oral and intravenous administration.""Vitamin C is effective in reducing duration of severe pneumonia in children less than five years of age. Oxygen saturation was improved in less than one day.""A recent placebo controlled study concluded that ""vitamin C should be included in treatment protocol of children with pneumonia so that mortality and morbidity can be reduced."" In this study, the majority of the children were infants under one year of age. By body weight, the modest 200 mg dose given, to tiny babies, would actually be the equivalent of 2,000-3,000 mg/day for an adult.Although many will rightly maintain that the dose should be high, even a low supplemental amount of vitamin C saves lives. This is very important for those with low incomes and few treatment options.We're talking about twenty cents' worth of vitamin C a day to save lives now.",0
"Breaking news: China is conducting a clinical trial of 24,000 mg/day of intravenous vitamin C to treat patients with coronavirus and severe respiratory complications. Participants will receive IV vitamin C for 7 days straight at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Honor and thanks are due to Zhiyong Peng, MD, for making this happen. He is chief physician and professor at the hospital, which is close to ground zero for coronavirus. This important study was filed and announced yesterday and details may be confirmed at. At Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, 24,000 mg of vitamin C will be administered to coronavirus patients, intravenously, each day for 7 days.To fight a dangerous virus for which there is no existing medical treatment, you must rely on your own immune system. It is well established, in every nutrition textbook ever written, that you need vitamin C to make your immune system work well, or to even work at all. Inadequate vitamin C intake is a worldwide problem that can be immediately and economically fixed. With even modest amounts of supplemental vitamin C, deaths will decrease. In one study, a mere 200 mg of vitamin C/day resulted in an 80% decrease in deaths among severely ill, hospitalized respiratory disease patients.Another recent study used this same low 200 mg dose for infants and children under five years of age, with severe pneumonia. The authors concluded that ""Vitamin C is effective in reducing duration of severe pneumonia in children less than five years of age. Oxygen saturation was improved in less than one day.""A lack of vitamin C has been long known, literally for decades, to increase susceptibility to viruses.It is one thing to be sick from a virus and another thing entirely to die from a viral-instigated disease. The greatest danger with coronavirus is escalation to pneumonia. For this, much higher doses of vitamin C are indicated, preferably by IV.

How to administer high-dose intravenous vitamin C in hospital, Chinese language edition, is now posted for free access. This information is now being publicized all over Asia. Just because it is not on the American news channels doesn't mean it's not happening. It is. This is real news. The fake news is the media's neglect in not reporting it. And here is the protocol in English, to make reporting all the easier",0
"The 2019-nCov (coronavirus) epidemic originated in Wuhan, China and is now spreading to many other continents and countries, causing a public fear. Worst of all, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral drugs for 2019-nCov available. This adds to the public fear and gloomy outlook. A quick, rapidly deployable and accessible, effective and also safe treatment is urgently needed to not only save those patients, to curtail the spread of the epidemic, but also very important in the psychological assurance to people worldwide, and to the Chinese in particular. Acute organ failure, especially pulmonary failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) is the key mechanism for 2019-nCov's fatality. Significantly increased oxidative stress due to the rapid release of free radicals and cytokines etc. is the hallmark of ARDS which leads to cellular injury, organ failure and death. Early use of large dose antioxidants, especially vitamin C (VC), therefore, plays a key role in the management of these patients. We call upon all those in the leadership, and those providing direct assistance patients, to bravely and rapidly apply large dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) to help those patients and to stop this epidemic.2019-nCov is a rapidly developing epidemic with a high morbidity and mortality.Wang et al reports 26% ICU admission rate and a 4.3% mortality rate in their 138 confirmed cases. Chen et all report that out of 99 confirmed 2019-nCov patients, 17 (17%) patients developed ARDS and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.Increased oxidative stress, an underlying ""cytokine storm,"" leads to ARDS which is the key pathology of high mortality of these pandemic viral infections. Cytokine storm-induced ARDS is the key pathology leading to death of these patients. Intravenous vitamin C effectively counters oxidative stress.Cytokine storm
Coronaviruses and influenza are among the pandemic viruses that can cause lethal lung injuries and death from ARDS. Viral infections cause a ""cytokine storm"" that can activate lung capillary endothelial cells leading to neutrophil infiltration and increased oxidative stress (reactive oxygen and nitrogen species) that further damages lung barrier function. ARDS, which is characterized by severe hypoxemia, is usually accompanied by uncontrolled inflammation, oxidative injury, and the damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier. The increased oxidative stress is a major insult in pulmonary injury such as acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), two clinical manifestations of acute respiratory failure with substantially high morbidity and mortality.
In a report of 29 patients confirmed of 2019-nCov pneumonia patients, 27 (93%) showed increased hsCRP, a marker of inflammation (and oxidative stress). Transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a major regulator of antioxidant response element- (ARE-) driven cytoprotective protein expression. The activation of Nrf2 signaling plays an essential role in preventing cells and tissues from injury induced by oxidative stress. Vitamin C is an essential element of the antioxidant system in cellular response.Part of vitamin C's biological effects in critical care management are well reviewed in a recent article by Nabzdyk and Bittner from Mass Gen Hospital of Harvard Medical School on World's Journal of Critical Care Medicine:Antioxidants, especially large dose IV vitamin C (IVC) in the management of ARDS.
It's clear that increased oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and death. Cytokine storm is observed in both viral and bacterial infections Cytokine storm leads to increased oxidative stress, ARDS and death seems to be a common and non-specific pathway. This is important in clinical management. Since the prevention and management targeting increased oxidative stress with large dose of antioxidants seems a logical step and can be applied to these deadly pandemics, without the lengthy waiting for pathogen-specific vaccines and drugs, as is the case of the current 2019-nCov epidemic.As a matter of fact, large dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) has been used clinically successfully in viral ARDS and also in influenza. Fowler et al described a 26-year-old woman developed viral ARDS (rhinovirus and enterovirus-D68). She was admitted to ICU. After failure to routine standard management, she was placed on ECMO on day 3. High dose IVC (200mg/kg body/24 hour, divided in 4 doses, one every 6 hours) was also started on ECMO day 1. Her lungs showed significant improvement on day 2 of high dose IVC infusion on X-ray imaging. She continued to improve on ECMO and IVC and ECMO was discontinued on ECMO day 7 and the patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital on hospital day 12, without the need of supplemental oxygen. One month later, X-ray of her lungs showed complete recovery. Gonzalez et al (including one of the authors, Thomas Levy) reported recently a severe case of influenza successfully treated with high dose IVC. 25-year-old MG developed flu-like symptoms which was rapidly deteriorating to the degree that, about 2 weeks later, the patient barely had the energy to use the toilet. He was placed on high dose IVC (50,000 mg of vitamin C in 1000 ml Ringer's solution, infused over 90 minutes). The patient immediately reported significant improvement the next day. On day 4 of IVC infusion he reported to feel normal. He continued oral VC (2,000 mg twice daily). Another story has been widely circulating on the social media that large dose IVC reportedly was used in 2009 to save a New Zealand farmer, Alan Smith (Primal Panacea). One of us (Thomas Levy) was consulted upon in this case [11] [12]. Hemila et al reported that vitamin C shortens ICU stay in their 2019 meta-analysis of 18 clinical studies with a total of 2004 ICU patients on the journal Nutrients. In this report, 17,000 mg/day IVC shortened the ICU stay by 44%. Marik et al reported their use of IVC in 47 sepsis ICU cases. They found a significant reduction in mortality rate in the IVC group of patients.Dietary antioxidants (vitamin C and sulforaphane) were shown to reduce oxidative-stress-induced acute inflammatory lung injury in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Other antioxidants (curcumin) have also been shown to have promising anti-inflammatory potential in pneumonia.High dose IVC has been clinically used for several decades and a recent NIH expert panel document states clearly that high dose IVC (1.5 g/kd body weight) is safe and without major side effects.Summary.2019-nCov pneumonia is a rapidly developing disease with high morbidity and mortality rate. The key pathogenesis is the acute lung injury causing ARDS and death. Coronaviruses, influenza viruses and many other pandemic viral infections are usually associated with an increase oxidative stress leasing to oxidative cellular damage resulting in multi-organ failure. Antioxidants administration therefore has a central role in the management of these conditions, in addition to the standard conventional supportive therapies. Preliminary clinical studies and case reports show that early administration of high dose IVC can improve clinical conditions of patients in ICU, ARDS and flu. It needs to be pointed that pandemics like 2019-nCov will happen in the future. Specific vaccines and antiviral drugs R&D take long time to develop and are not available for the current nCov epidemic and won't be ready when the next pandemic strikes. IVC and other antioxidants are universal agents for ARDS that can be rapidly applied clinically. Given that high dose IVC is safe, can be effective, we call on the involved leadership and healthcare professionals to look into high dose IVC without further delay. More clinical studies of the IVC and oral VC (such as liposomal-encapsulated VC) are needed to develop standard protocols for the current use and future uses are urgently needed. We hope when the next pandemic strikes, we won't be so helpless and we'll be ready.",0

How to discontinue home isolation.People with COVID-19 who have stayed home (home isolated) can leave home under the following conditions.If you have not had a test to determine if you are still contagious, you can leave home after these three things have happened: You have had no fever for at least 72 hours (that is three full days of no fever without the use of medicine that reduces fevers) AND other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND at least 10 days have passed since your symptoms first appeared. If you have had a test to determine if you are still contagious, you can leave home after these three things have happened: You no longer have a fever (without the use of medicine that reduces fevers) AND other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND you received two negative tests in a row, at least 24 hours apart. Your doctor will follow CDC guidelines.People who DID NOT have COVID-19 symptoms, but tested positive and have stayed home (home isolated) can leave home under the following conditions.
If you have not had a test to determine if you are still contagious, you can leave home after these two things have happened:
At least 10 days have passed since the date of your first positive test. AND you continue to have no symptoms (no cough or shortness of breath) since the test.If you have had a test to determine if you are still contagious, you can leave home after:You received two negative tests in a row, at least 24 hours apart. Your doctor will follow CDC guidelines.Note: if you develop symptoms, follow guidance above for people with COVID19 symptoms.In all cases, follow the guidance of your doctor and local health department. The decision to stop home isolation should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider and state and local health departments. Some people, for example those with conditions that weaken their immune system, might continue to shed virus even after they recover.Find more information on when to end home isolation.",1
"This video shows why Big Telecom loves #coronavirus. The quarantine has facilitated the unobstructed #5G rollout and has effectively ended the opportunity for mass public protests which were our best hope for derailing the 5G robber barons from microwaving our country and destroying nature. The Telecom Titans now have an open road, willing politicians and a compliant population sufficiently frightened, beleaguered, broke and submissive to relinquish their constitutional freedoms and welcome the surveillance state. 5G has little to do with improving service to individuals. It has everything to do with #BigTech data mining, surveillance and social control. If we don’t stop them, they will engineer a massive transfer of wealth and sovereignty away from our citizens into the hands of Big Telecom, Big Tech (Microsoft, Facebook, Google) #BigPharma, the military/intelligence apparatus and the ruling plutocrats. Chief among these is Bill Gates with his sinister anti-American tracking system (ID2020), his suspiciously coincidental October 2019 Coronavirus War Game simulations (Gates passed out adorable coronavirus themed stuffed animals to all the high level participants), his pandemic documentary on #Netflix, his autocratic control of Anthony Fauci and the WHO (for which he is the top funder), his coronavirus #vaccine patents and his barely disguised — let’s be honest — giddy-delight at the quarantine that is impoverishing his countrymen and crushing their will to resist his tyrannical “reforms.” Gates wants us to cede all power to his “benevolent” dictatorship —including power over our bodies, our health and our children.

Coronavirus Hoax: Fake Virus Pandemic Fabricated to Cover-Up Global Outbreak of 5G Syndrome.,0
"5G SYNDROME GOES GLOBAL. Wuhan coronavirus pandemic STAGED to cover-up the public health crisis caused by the intensive 5G roll-out in Wuhan in 2019. “China was long ago set to be the 5G showcase for the world. Major metro areas and technology hubs like Wuhan were selected to be official 5G Demonstration Zones. Only such a high concentration of 5G radio-frequency transmitters and microwave towers would permit a citywide build-out of the Internet of Things. 2019 was the year Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, was “expected to have 10,000 5G base stations by the end of 2019, said Song Qizhu, head of Hubei Provincial Communication Administration”. Then the coronavirus hit, so the whole world was told. What really happened was that a new variant of the coronavirus was released in Wuhan after the 5G experimenters saw an epidemic of 5G Syndrome explode. The 5G guinea pigs were literally dropping like flies as soon as they flipped the 5G switch. The ERs and urgent care clinics were overwhelmed. The 5G scientists watching the burgeoning public health crisis immediately activated Plan B:Blame it on a virulent flu—a bioengineered coronavirus that produces symptoms similar to 5G Syndrome.”Intelligence Analyst and Former U.S. Army Officer.The New World Order globalist cabal will not allow anything to impede the military deployment of 5G worldwide.That’s it!",0
"There’s a LOT of hard evidence now emerging the further away we get from the original crime scene in Wuhan, China and as the coronavirus pops up around the world in 5G Hotspots that indicates this pandemic is being manufactured for multiple reasons.As it turns out, those nations with the most advanced 5G roll-outs have the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases, both infection rates and death rates.In those countries that have permitted IoT build-outs where the 5G power grids are the most developed, the coronavirus infection rate is taking off.What’s really interesting is that Africa has thus far shown very few cases. As of this weekend there were only 3 medically acknowledged cases on the entire continent. Which begs the question: How do the Third World countries in Africa avoid such a contagious strain of the coronavirus given the pervasive lack of proper sanitation and necessary hygiene?In light of how deeply involved the Chinese are with development projects all over Africa, it’s quite curious how that infection number is still so low. Perhaps it’s directly related to the absence of 5G roll-outs in the vast majority of African nations.Before those nations suffering the greatest number of coronavirus infections to date are further investigated — China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Germany, United States, France, Spain, Kuwait — another curious development ought to be looked at closely.The Proof is in the Cruise Ships.The single best proof of the quite obvious 5G-Coronavirus linkage are the various cruise ships that have seen an inexplicable mushrooming of coronavirus cases, even after all the passengers were quarantined.Many of the biggest cruise lines now advertise the fact that they have the latest and greatest 5G technologies in place. The most advanced cruise ships actually possess the best examples of what the Internet of Things (IoT) will look like in the future … if the build-outs proceed unimpeded by the very serious health concerns and safety issues.KEY POINT: Cruise-goers, by and large, love to stay connected with the folks back home. They especially enjoy texting their many photos-by-smartphone back to family and friends. Businessmen have a need to stay in touch with the office as other passengers want to stay abreast of all the breaking news in 2020. Hence, every cruise ship will eventually become a 5G–IoT paradise if they’re not already.What really happened on the quarantined cruise ships is that those folks were likely quite vulnerable to the flu bug for a variety of reasons. Then, when they entered the fully operational 5G space* on the ships, their immunity was profoundly weakened so that they would be susceptible any influenza strain, including the Wuhan coronavirus—COVID-19.The cruise lines have literally put their 5G technology on super-steroids as seen in this promotion: MedallionNet: The Best Wi-Fi at Sea.5G Nations.It has also been astutely observed that those nations with the most pervasive and powerful 5G networks fully functioning are those that have suffered the biggest outbreaks of the coronavirus to date. Why should anyone be surprised at this wholly predictable outcome?The following excerpt comes from: CORONAVIRUS BOMBSHELL: This proves it should be named “5G COVID-19”.The importance of viewing the coronavirus COVID-19 as a “Telephone Disease” is that by doing so it explains some perplexing mysteries about the spread of this disease—such as why this disease has struck the Gulf nations and monarchies in the Persian Gulf region, but becomes explainable when one notices their ongoing 5G revolution—most particularly in Iran, where this country is completely blanketed to its smallest village with 4G technology coverage—but who are now putting the finishing touches on rolling out 5G technology throughout their entire nation in the coming weeks—finishing touches that included Iran activating their Chinese bought 5G technology for testing—that was immediately met by Iran having more coronavirus cases and deaths of any nation outside of China—and whose Vice President is one of seven of their top government officials now infected.Coronavirus COVID-19 disease outbreak begins to spread in Persian Gulf nations and monarchies activating 5G technology.Both 5G Demonstration Zones such as Wuhan, China and floating 5G cruise liners are correctly considered 5G Hotspots. These 5G Hotspots, for the uninitiated, are really KILL ZONES because many folks will die early the longer they bask in those dangerously high levels of 5G radio-frequencies and microwave radiation.The following excerpt from a previous exposé provides critical links for every individual who lives, works and/or plays in a 5G Super-Hotspots.Which brings us to the single most perilous aspect of the military deployment of 5G—KILL ZONES.All the scientific evidence available in the public domain now indicates that wherever 5G infrastructure is located in the greatest concentration generating the most powerful EMFs and microwaves, those 5G Super-Hotspots will effectively function as kill zones. As follows:5G Super-Hotspots: You better know where the “kill zones” are located!In order to fully grasp the highly destructive and deadly potential of these rapidly emerging 5G Super-Hotspots, the following video exposé presents a scenario where the most powerful “directed energy weapons” will be located within these 5G kill zones.",0
"How do you know if you have 5G Flu or 5G Syndrome or both?Coronavirus Contagion Much More Virulent and Deadly in 5G Hotspots. It’s of paramount importance to comprehend that there is a HUGE difference between 5G Flu and 5G Syndrome.It especially behoves every smartphone user to know the difference.People who live in 5G hotspots also really need to know the difference.Internet addicts who are setting up their own IoT space inside of a 5G super-hotspot better know the difference as their life depends on it.5G Flu or 5G Syndrome. An unknown number of smartphone addicts are blissfully unaware that they may be suffering from either a low-grade 5G Flu or asymptomatic 5G Syndrome. Wherever 5G Flu is written below in the “KEY POINTS“, direct involvement of the Wuhan coronavirus (aka COVID-19) is implied in its distinctive pathology, biological evolution, cellular etiology and more elusive environmental causation.KEY POINTS: 5G Syndrome is a much more serious medical ailment than 5G Flu. 5G Syndrome represents a much more extensive list of severe symptoms, some of which are life-threatening. However, as the whole world has witnessed, 5G Flu can also kill you—FAST—depending on your overall health profile and the strength of your immune system. That’s why the elderly and infirm succumb to 5G Flu so quickly … and children seem to have a natural immunity.
Nonetheless, it’s 5G Syndrome that is the quiet killer because of how many symptoms will occur completely under the radar over years. Also, many of those symptoms will be routinely misinterpreted as other disease processes by medical and holistic doctors alike. This kind of misdiagnosis and under-diagnosis by physicians everywhere has occurred over several decades regarding Electrohypersensitivity illness, often by the intentional design of the Medical-Big Pharma Complex.Then there are those individuals who suffer from both 5G Flu and early-onset 5G Syndrome; they’re the ones dropping like flies in Wuhan, China. Their addiction to smartphones and other wireless devices blinded them to the adverse health effects caused by the sudden influx of 5G energies (which include extremely high radiofrequency signal ranges and ultra-strong microwave transmissions) when they flipped the switch in 2019 in Hubei Province.
In general, 5G Flu is more of an acute illness whereas 5G Syndrome is a long-term, chronic disease. They mutually support and feed off each other which is what makes them so dangerous and increasingly fatal. A person who has 5G Syndrome is much more susceptible to contracting 5G Flu. And, a person with 5G Flu is a good candidate for developing 5G Syndrome.One who repeatedly gets the Wuhan coronavirus (or 5G Flu), as many Chinese sufferers have to date, will exhibit a greater likelihood of developing 5G Syndrome; that is, if they don’t already have a case of it. The extraordinary re-infection rates for COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus bioweapon triggering 5G Flu, offer compelling circumstantial evidence that it’s really an electromagnetic radiation-driven disease more than a bioengineered coronavirus; although, it’s really both co-factors working in tandem to turbo-charge each other.Truly, the ‘inexplicable’ re-infection rates tell the hidden back story about this swiftly unfolding pandemic. The only plausible reason for multiple re-infections, when compared to all previously studied coronavirus outbreaks prior to the WiFi era, is that the former COVID-19 patients have stepped back into their wireless environment, they live in a 5G hotspot, they are creating their own IoT and/or they still sleep with their smartphones — TURNED ON — under their pillows.
5G Syndrome insidiously develops over a period of sustained exposure to a 5G power grid and/or usage of even a small-scale version of a home-based IoT or a full-scale office build-out of the Internet of Things. The longer any individual sits in those unsafe levels of 5G-disseminated EMFs and microwaves, the more likely they will experience the evolution of their own unique form of 5G Syndrome. Eventually, they will become vulnerable to not only 5G Flu (i.e. Wuhan coronavirus), but also to the whole host of other bioengineered flu strains and naturally occurring influenzas.The most critical point here is that every long-term, habitual smartphone user is at great risk for developing either 5G Flu and 5G Syndrome, or both. During the annual flu seasons, they will be more susceptible than others to any type of influenza that passes through the neighborhood, especially one of the various coronaviruses.The symptoms of both. What will eventually follow in this blog is a list of symptoms of both 5G Flu and 5G Syndrome which will distinguish the one medical ailment from the other. Inevitably, there will be many symptoms that overlap for obvious reasons, but even those will have subtle differences to the trained clinician.This future list of 5G symptoms will by no means be exhaustive and will be added to in the weeks and months and years ahead. Its compilation represents a collaborative effort among many like-minded healthcare professionals and health advocates who deeply understand the intimate connection between the human bio-organism and ambient electromagnetic fields.These medical clinicians, alternative healthcare practitioners and biomedical researchers are especially aware of the numerous adverse health effects and profound environmental impacts produced by the rapidly emerging 5G power grid. Connecting the most crucial dots has become easier as the 5G roll-out takes place in cities nationwide as well as worldwide.China has provided an excellent observation laboratory with the Wuhan 5G Demonstration Zone being the most watched experiment in the world today. Some have even noted that the Wuhanese have sacrificed themselves for the sake of enlightening the rest of humanity. Now it’s time for the Chinese government to share the medical data and scientific observations so that their 5G roll-out can be properly implicated in this paralyzing public health crisis.There are many symptoms which constitute either the 5G Flu or 5G Syndrome symptom set, as well as those that are common to both. The due diligence process and proper vetting required to confirm them with a high level of integrity is quite tedious and challenging. Nevertheless, this project is proceeding with all deliberate speed in the interest of precluding a public health disaster of epic proportions. Our real intention is to avert a full-blown ELE (Extinction Level Event) in light of the 5G juggernaut rolling across the land on all 7 continents.The following two links provide just a glimpse into the enormity and gravity of this vast biomedical research project. This “Special Report” is very much a work-in-progress and will be posted in its entirety in the near future. One of the writer-researchers is also The Coronavirus Coach and, therefore, we are still identifying the various and sundry symptoms that define both 5G Flu and 5G Syndrome. In the meantime, every person who suspects that they suffer from either of these medical ailments, or if they have been medically diagnosed with COVID-19, ought to read the symptoms of EHS listed here: Electrohypersensitivity Syndrome: The Symptoms & Some Solutions.",0
"URGENT! Practical Advice for Coronavirus Prevention and Holistic Remediation. CORONAVIRUS Precautionary Measures and Health Tips.The Coronavirus Coach.The rapidly unfolding coronavirus pandemic should not be underestimated. Given what is known thus far, this highly contagious virus ought to be taken seriously by everyone. Hence, every person on the planet is encouraged to get their house in order (especially the medicine cabinet) so that they are ready for any eventuality.It’s always best to take these proven preventive measures sooner than later where it concerns any type of viral infection. By doing so, even the various coronavirus infections can be avoided. Folks who can sequester themselves in their home offices and/or significantly reduce their exposure to public places always fare much better. “Catching the corona” is by no means a foregone conclusion for any individual.List of Basic Things To Do.First, start to eat right (LOTs of garlic and ginger and turmeric and curried foods). Lean toward hot soups, stews and broths particularly at dinner time for the rest of the flu season. Avoid cold foods from the fridge especially yoghurt, sandwich spreads and cold drinks. Add just a little boiling water to quickly warm up juices as well as nut or seed milks. Frozen foods like ice cream are strictly forbidden. Cook all vegetables much softer than usual. Best to go vegan, if possible; otherwise, all animal meats ought to be very well cooked and eaten infrequently.Drink Flu Tea, especially during the cold season (the essential ingredients are ginger, cayenne pepper, lemon and honey but don’t heat the lemon or the honey–add them after the fresh ginger tea is brewed). Also drink plenty of warm fluids, specifically herbal teas that are decongestants and expectorants. Herbal teas that have antimicrobial and immune-stimulating properties are important when viral infection symptoms are present.
Be regular about replenishing the diminished intestinal flora with probiotics; beverage and food-based forms are much preferred to nutraceuticals (e.g. capsules). For those with lactose intolerance and/or casein allergies, acquire some coconut, cashew or almond yogurt or kefir (let these warm up first before eating). Also, consider probiotic rectal implants when significant flora depletion is suspected.Be sure to stay away from mucus-producing foods and beverages. Avoid dairy in particular (especially cheese, milk and ice cream). Also avoid wheat, white sugar, red meat, eggs, soy, alcohol, artificially sweetened sodas, desserts in general, etc. This is a great time to minimize the intake of processed foods, packaged food, canned food, frozen food and especially junk food and fast food. “Corporate food” in supermarkets ought to be reduced; fresh produce, whole grains, organic ingredients, etc. are much healthier choices. The shorter the distance from farm to table the better.If restaurant food cannot be avoided, be careful to only order the most cooked items on the menu. Raw foods and dairy products are quite exposed to environmental pathogens as well as highly vulnerable to kitchen mismanagement practices and other types of contamination. Don’t eat out unless you must. And, go organic, fresh, locally-grown and what’s in season IN YOUR OWN KITCHEN. Remember: “The cure is in the kitchen.”Start to transition your diet from acidifying foods to alkalizing foods so that you move to approx. 75% alkaline and 25% acidic. Especially cut down on constipating foods, beverages and nutraceuticals such as mineral supplements with too much Iron.Regular Exercise and Stretching, Power Walking and Rebounding, Hatha Yoga and Pilates, Tai chi and Qigong are all great to do. Get as much exposure to Sunlight as possible for natural Vitamin D production. (Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants so the coronavirus doesn’t like it). A 20 to 30 minute aerobic walk in nature is the single best way to cleanse the entire lymphatic system—A MUST![1] Don’t power walk outside when the skies are heavily chemtrailed; you’ll feel the health consequences.The respiratory system must be clear and clean, strong and efficient since this virus targets the mucus membranes in the lungs and sinuses. Use a Neti Pot regularly during this flu season with 1/4 tsp of sea salt dissolved in body-temperature distilled water. Have a saline nasal rinse kit on hand such as NEILMED’S SINUS RINSE. Breathwork as simple as daily deep breathing outside in the fresh air is highly recommended; so are certain pranayama practices. Coherent breathing is particularly effective in activating the body’s natural immune response.Try to sleep well between 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM every night. Keep all technology out of the bedroom including smartphones and TVs. Remove all light sources, cover the windows, and use an air purifier that generates white noise to cover up distracting night-time sounds.Change all IT devices in the home from wireless and WiFi to wired connections. Even keyboards and mice ought to be hardwired. Those living or working in a 5G environment ought to eliminate all WiFi completely.Use wired landline phones whenever possible, NOT smartphones. There are also free Internet-based phone lines available that are easily hardwired. Replace the smartphone with an old-fashioned 4G flip phone. (Wuhan City, China was designated a special “5G Demonstration Zone” in the months prior to the coronavirus outbreak.Assemble a first aid kit with Colloidal Silver or Silver Hydrosol, Zinc supplements, Turmeric power or extract, Vitamin C and Vitamin D. Have a CAL-MAG-POT mineral supplement handy as well as some Selenium.Acquire some anti-microbial Essential Oils (especially Oils of Oregano, Basil, Thyme & Peppermint). Get some Thieves essential oil and an atomizer to diffuse in the ambient environment, particularly the bedroom before sleep!Also, have Olive Leaf extract, Pau d’Arco tea and an Echinacea & Goldenseal combo in the medicine cabinet. Buy some Grapefruit Seed extract, in liquid form, for all sorts of medicinal and body care applications.Keep some food-grade Hydrogen Peroxide in the fridge in the event that low-dose HP therapy becomes necessary. Lugol’s Iodine is an absolute must when fighting any coronavirus, and especially effective for cleaning ALL produce. Buy some BAC-HP homeopathic remedy to quickly subdue any bacterial infections that can weaken immunity (Purchase link HERE).Have a good supply of Sea Salt available for gargling as well as Rock Salt for cooking. Pink Himalayan Salt is especially good for medicinal use. Manuka Honey has strong antibacterial and antiviral properties as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits.Mouth care should include daily tongue scraping first thing in the morning followed by a Sovereign Silver mouth bath (hold 1 tbsp of silver in mouth for 20 to 30 minutes after teeth-brushing.Then spit it out and thoroughly rinse mouth with water. For us health nuts, this can be followed with 15 t0 20 minutes of oil pulling by swishing around in the mouth 1 tbsp of either sesame or coconut oil. (The toothbrush should be washed with peppermint soap after each use and soaked in hydrogen peroxide at least once a week.For those who get really sick or really are ambitious, do a coffee enema. There’s no quicker way to cleanse and refresh the liver blood. Moreover, performing a gallbladder flush / liver cleanse is an effective way to decongest the liver which then enhances the detoxification pathways during sickness, disease or injury.
Take a crash course in strengthening your immune system at this website: The Health Coach. For those who are chronically experiencing any form of immunosuppression, it’s imperative to do an immune system checkup. Particularly for those folks who have suffered from any of the Chronic Degenerative Diseases or Third Millennium Maladies or Alphabet Soup Ailments (e.g. CFS, EBV, AIDS, HIV, COPD, MS, ALS, Lupus, Lyme, Morgellons, Fibromyalgia, Rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders), conducting a systematic immune system audit is a MUST. Whereas a strong immune response is the BEST defense against the coronavirus, even a compromised immune system can be quickly strengthened. For example, an infected root canal or cavitation site can be properly remediated thereby removing a constant burden from the immune system.Wash hands thoroughly for at least 20 to 30 seconds with an anti-microbial soap after being out in public but especially after handling all mail and parcels; raw food items; and food packaging such as boxes, cans, cartons, bottles, plastic containers as well as beverage cups.Regularly sanitize all door handles and faucet handles as well as vehicle door handles and the steering wheel. Be sure to keep Ethyl Alcohol and Distilled White Vinegar on hand to disinfect contaminated surfaces, especially in the kitchen and bathrooms. There are individually wrapped hand wipes, which use alcohol to kill pathogenic micro-organisms on contact, to keep in the vehicle as well as hand sanitizers that do the same for the home and office.[5] . Above all, avoid touching your eyes, ears, nose or mouth (your head, for that matter) with unwashed hands.This particular strain of coronavirus could develop into a serious situation (i.e. Pandemic) which will then require great vigilance and resolve. Be alert to any unusual symptoms in the home and workplace for yourself and others. Stay away from any individual who is presenting any type of flu symptoms.Avoid all public places, when practical, for the rest of this flu season. If you are the family caregiver or a healthcare provider, take all the extra precautionary measures to avoid exposure (wear the right type of hospital-grade mask rated as N95 anti-viral, wash hands regularly with antimicrobial soap, keep a safe distance when appropriate, etc.). Disinfect, Sanitize and Cleanse whatever, wherever and whenever necessary. The kitchen and bathrooms need to be cleaner than ever since that’s where most illness and disease begin.Don’t travel unnecessarily. Especially avoid airplanes, trains, buses, subways and cruise ships. At least for the rest of this flu season, minimize attendance at family gatherings, office parties, restaurants, etc. Skip all the conventions, conferences, forums, seminars and other large meeting places this year, particularly those with overnight stays.Lastly, stay out of fear and live life with courage during these challenging times. Have faith in the Higher Power and know that everything always happens for the best. Pray for protection for yourself, your family and friends, and all of humanity.",0
"The special case of the Coronavirus, Vitamin C – Coronavirus: Exploring Effective Nutritional Treatments, Andrew W. Saul, Orthomolecular News Service; January 30, 2020. This article is based on more than 30 clinical studies confirming the antiviral power of vitamin C against a wide range of flu viruses over several decades. Vitamin C inactivates the virus and strengthens the immune system to continue to suppress the virus. In many cases, oral supplementation up to 10,000 mg daily can create this protection. However, some viruses are stronger and may require larger doses given intravenously (100,000 to 150,000 mg daily). Vitamin C helps the body to make its own antioxidant, glutathione as well assist the body in the production of its own antiviral called interferon. If IV vitamin C is not available there have been cases where some people have gradually increased their oral dose up to 50,000 mg daily before reaching bowel tolerance. Powdered or crystal forms of high quality ascorbic acid can be taken five grams (5,000 mg) at a time, every four hours. Every virus seems to respond to this type of treatment, regardless of the whether it is SARs, Bird flu, Swine flu or the new Coronavirus flu. Vitamin D3 – Vitamin D helps fend off flu, asthma attacks, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, March 10, 2010. This was a double-blind placebo controlled study where the treatment group consumed 1,200 IU of vitamin D3 during the cold and flu season, while the control group took a placebo. The vitamin D group had a 58% reduced risk of flu. Vitamin D3 is also very effective in the treatment of virus/flu infections:Vitamin D3 helps our body to make an antibiotic protein called cathelicidin, which is known to kill viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites.
Vitamin D deficiency for adults is 42%, but this is incorrect because the standards are too low. Levels of 30-50 ng/ml are said to be adequate, but every scientific study has shown that levels of 50-100 ng/ml are needed for true protection.Diet and sunshine are good sources of vitamin D, but most people need to supplement, especially during flu season. Between 5,000-10,000 IU daily is often recommended in the form of a quality liquid supplement.When you get the flu Dr. John Cannel recommends taking 50,000 IU daily for the first 5 days, and then 5.000-10,000 IU as a maintenance dose. Silver – Silver Kills Viruses, Journal of Nanotechnology, October 18, 2005. This study found that silver nanoparticles kills HIV-1 and virtually any other viruses. The study was jointly conducted by the University of Texas and Mexico University. After incubating HIV-1 virus at 37 C, the silver particles killed 100% of the virus within 3 hours. Silver employs a unique mechanism of action to kill viruses.Silver binds to the membrane of the virus, limiting its oxygen supply and suffocating it.Silver also binds to the DNA of the virus cell, preventing it from multiplying.Silver is also able to prevent the transfer of the virus from one person to another by blocking the ability of the virus to find a host cell to feed on. All viruses need host cells to survive.Colloidal silver can also be used at doses of 10-20 ppm. Nanoparticle sliver is preferred.The best defense against swine flu, bird flu or the new coronavirus may be a few teaspoons of sliver every day. Bacteria and viruses cannot develop a resistance like many other treatments can. Silver disables a vital enzyme and mechanism in pathogens, so they cannot survive.Other evidence-based herbal strategies for the flu.In addition to the previously mentioned vitamin strategies for preventing and treating virus-related illnesses, there are several herbal remedies that are also effective. Here are a few with proven scientific evidence behind them:Elderberry – A study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine found elderberry can be used as a safe and effective treatment for influenza A and B.Calendula – A study by the University of Maryland Medical Center found that ear drops containing calendula can be effective for treating ear infections in children.Astragulus root – Scientific studies have shown that Astragulus has anti-viral properties and stimulates the immune system. One study in the Chinese Medical Sciences Journal concluded that Astragulus is able to inhibit the growth of coxsackie B virus.Licorice root – Licorice is gaining popularity for the prevention and treatment of diseases, such as hepatitis C, HIV and influenza. (The Chinese Journal of Virology published a review of these findings. Olive leaf – Olive leaf has been proven effective in the treatment of cold and flu viruses, meningitis, pneumonia, hepatitis B, malaria, gonorrhea and tuberculosis. One study at the New York University School of Medicine found that olive leaf extracts reversed many HIV-1 infections.These are just some of the many anti-viral agents that should be included in everyone’s home remedy medicine chest. It may also be helpful to know which foods can provide the best anti-vital protection. Certain foods can provide strong anti-viral production. Some of the strongest foods in this category include:
Wild blueberries.Sprouts.Cilantro.Coconut oil.Garlic.Ginger.Sweet potatoes.Turmeric.Red clover.Parsley.Kale.Fennel.Pomegranates.Conclusion.It is a generally accepted fact that once a virus is in the body it very seldom leaves. The medications, vitamins and herbs that have been proven to be effective simply suppress the virus and limit its ability to reproduce. A strong immune system is the key to preventing and/or successfully treating any chronic illness. The key elements of this protection program include: Eating a plant-based whole food diet with very limited animal products.Adding daily nutritional supplements such as a multiple vitamin/mineral, 2000 mg of vitamin C with bioflavonoids, maintain vitamin D3 levels of 50-90 ng/mL, 1000-2000 mg of Omega 3 oils, a vitamin B complex and about 400 mg of magnesium depending on your level of exercise.
Avoid toxins and use detoxification programs periodically.Regular daily exercise-aerobic, resistance and flexibility.Avoid stress and use yoga and meditation to manage stress.Wash your hands with soap and water after touching areas that have been touched by others.In the home, there is a new product, PureGreen24, that kills Staph, MRSA and most viruses within two minutes. This product has an EPA IV toxicity rating and is safe and effective for hospitals as well as for children and pets at home.Avoid putting your hands to your face.Avoid anyone who is experiencing flu and cold symptoms.At the first signs of any cold or flu symptoms begin a fairly aggressive treatment protocol. The sooner treatment begins the better the chance is that the infection can be stopped and/or controlled.
By adhering to this basic anti-viral strategy, it is possible to greatly reduce the risk of these virus-related illnesses, as well as most other illnesses. Conventional medicine offers very little for the prevention or treatment of most viral illnesses. Natural medicine offers considerably more solutions.",0
"One of the biggest challenges designing a strategy to address MERS with herbs is that the virus is relatively new and unknown. So, I chose to look at what is known to form the basis of my best “educated guess”, such as:the nature of coronaviruses, the symptoms of MERS, herbs with known antiviral actions, existing herbal recommendations for SARS, with which MERS has much in common, more details about viruses in general than I ever wanted to know, Viruses are strands of either DNA or RNA. They have no cell wall, but some are called “encapsulated” as they are covered in a layer of protein, the shape of which is unique to that virus strain. Once inside the body, the virus moves into the cells and is able to incorporate either DNA or RNA from the host into itself.DNA viruses tend to be more stable and mutate less, while RNA viruses tend to have far more fluctuation and mutate easily. Where DNA viruses make billions of stable copies of itself, RNA viruses make billions of copies with lots of variation.Coronaviruses present some unique challenges as an RNA virus.Because RNA viruses mutate frequently, it is not reasonable to expect a vaccine to come to market and be effective for any length of time. RNA viruses are highly adaptable, and their variation allows for responsiveness. However, coronaviruses have the largest genome of all RNA viruses (that we know of), and therefore have a real potential for
If a vaccine or other pharmaceutical were developed, neither would be useful for long. New vaccines would have to be made on an ongoing basis, which can take 3-6 months to develop. In the meantime, infected persons would be traveling and carrying the virus with them into new territory.In this case, herbal and plant-based remedies *may* have the edge over pharmaceuticals due to their complex and synergistic nature, whereas pharmaceuticals focus on singular active ingredients. Plants, by their very nature, are a complex and unique combination of chemical constituents, which are far more challenging to both bacteria and viral infections.While MERS is a relatively new virus, it is very similar to another coronavirus, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). A study was done and published in the Lancet detailing the similarities and differences between the two. To read more about this study, click here and here. Similarities include: Incubation periods (4-5 days), Presenting symptoms (very similar to influenza), Lung Pathology (potential for pneumonia and cytokine storms). The study found,
“Most patients admitted to hospital exhibited fever (98%), chills/rigors (87%), cough (83%), shortness of breath (72%), and muscle pain (32%). A quarter of patients also experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and vomiting.”This study is almost a year old, and several things have changed. The mortality rate has dropped from 60% to 30%. As awareness and better identification of MERS grows, more of the mild cases are being reported. It seems that the cases that ended in death of the patient correlate to patients who had pre-existing conditions, especially diabetes. According to the study,“However, in contrast to SARS, the majority of cases (96%) occurred in people with underlying chronic medical conditions including diabetes (68%), high blood pressure (34%), chronic heart disease (28%), and chronic renal disease (49%).”All of these details tell us a number of very useful things to develop an herbal strategy for MERS.The similarities between SARS and MERS mean that herbs that are effective for SARS are most likely effective for MERS. Herbs long-used for comfort measures against influenza would likely be effective to provide comfort against MERS.Addressing pre-existing conditions with herbs is likely a good way to prevent a mild case of MERS from becoming a serious case or worse, a fatality.Herbs with strong anti-viral properties that also protect against cytokine storms would be very useful.Herbs Used In Fighting Coronaviruses.Below is a list of herbs and essential oils that meet these objectives. These are either antiviral or supporting, syngeristic herbs. It will take several more posts to details what they can do and how to make herbal remedies with them. As I write them, I will link back to this page.Chinese Skullcap, Scutellaria baicalensis (not American Skullcap)
Licorice, Glycyrrhiza glabra (used as a synergist- with other herbs, not by itself). Kudzu, Pueraria lobata
Ginko biloba.Angelica sinensis.Astragalus mongholicus.Japanese knotweed, Polygonum cuspidatum.Rhodiola rosea.Cordyceps sinensis.Olive leaf, Olea europaea.Elder, Sambucus nigra.Cinnamon, Cinnamomum zeylanicum.Berberine herbs.Red Root, Ceanothus americanus.Cleavers, Galium aparine.Salvia miltiorrhiza.Dyer’s Woad, Isatis tinctoria.The following herbs are beneficial for influenza relief, and would likely be helpful for the symptoms associated with MERS (those influenza herbs that are also included above are not duplicated below):Echinacea angustafolia.Ginger, Zingiber officinale.Pleurisy root, Asclepias tuberosa. Cayenne, Capsicum annum.Elecampane, Inula helenium.Hyssop, Hyssopus officinalis.Slippery or Siberian Elm, Ulmus rubra.Boneset, Eupatorium perfoliatum.Horehound, Marrubium vulgare.Sage, Salvia officinalis.Marshmallow, Althaea officinalis.Clove, Syzygium aromaticum.Coltsfoot, Tussilago farfara.Mullein leaf, Verbascum densiflorum. Peppermint, Mentha piperita.Thyme, Thymus vulgaris.Garlic, Allium sativum.Horseradish, Armoracia rusticana.Lemon, Citrus limon.Honey. Essential Oils.The oils listed below each assist the respiratory system. Some are better for children, some are better for adults who can handle a more intense essential oil. Use these oils with Warning: DO NOT INGEST! These oils are to be taken through INHALATION ONLY! I am quite aware of the multi-level marketing companies out there that tout ingestion as the end all be all for every ailment known to humankind. The casual manner in which such potent oils are being used is a dangerous practice, especially in the hands of sales reps with no aromatherapy training. There is a time and place for ingesting oils. This isn’t it.Thyme, Thymus vulgaris.Oregano, Origanum vulgare.Eucalyptus, Eucalyptus globulus.Rosemary, Rosmarinus officinalis.Lavender, Lavandula angustifolia.Sage, Salvia officinalis.Additionally, herbs indicated for diabetes, hypertension, cardiac issues, and kidney problems, dietary changes that improve these conditions, plus any other steps you can take to improve illnesses such as these should be implemented now. MERS is far more deadly to people already experiencing chronic disease.",0
"Time for an Ounce of Prevention.We all look forward to the Breath-Body-Mind workshops hosted by Serving Those Who Serve. However, this year, we are cancelling the March workshop to prevent exposing anyone to the coronavirus (COVID-19). In Japan, the healthcare researchers discovered that being in a room with a group of people dramatically increased the risk of transmission. Based on previous viral epidemics, we anticipate the next three months may be the period of the highest health risk. If we are unable to reschedule, then we will see you at the September workshop. We are looking into the possibility of providing Breath-Body-Mind workshops by webinar.Here are our recommendations for reducing the risk of COVID-19.Advice for Better Immune Defense and Prevention.The coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread and is likely to become a health concern everywhere within the coming months. There is no specific treatment in sight other than general recommendations for rest, fluids, nutrition, and symptomatic treatment of fever. However, there are measures that we can take to strengthen our immune defenses. This approach may reduce the likelihood of getting sick or, even if you acquire the virus, immune boosters can help to reduce the severity and shorten the length of illness.Because this is becoming a health crisis, we want to share with you a list of immune boosters that we rely on and that may be of help to you and your families. We only recommend the brands listed below because they have been studied and shown to be effective and of good quality. If you have any serious health conditions or allergies, please consult your personal physician and read the contents of each supplement before taking.  Also, follow recommendations for when to take these supplements. We do not receive any financial remuneration from supplement companies.Supplements to Boost Immune Defense. Kold-Care (Immune Kare) from Kare-n-Herbs at Karenherbs.com. For prevention Take 1 tab twice daily for prevention. If symptoms or exposure occur, take 1 tab 4 times daily. Respigard by Nature’s Nurse (Amazon).If symptoms or exposure occur, follow directions on the bottle for dosing. Immune Senescence Protection from Life Extension Foundation.Prevention: Take 2 daily right after eating breakfast (food prevents stomach upset). Bio-Strath available online from multiple companies. Follow directions on bottle.Sambucus by Nature’s Way.Prevention and if symptoms occur. Follow directions on bottle.If symptoms or exposure occur, follow directions on the bottle for dosing. Mushroom extracts: Maitake-D and Shiitake from the following companies: Mushroom Science, Mushroom Wisdom or Nature’s Way). Follow directions on bottle.Additional advice to optimize your body’s natural defense capacities.Get lots of rest. Go to bed earlier and readjust your activities as needed.Healthy diet is important with fresh fruits and vegetables every day.Drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated.For Prevention: Do Coherent Breathing 20 min a day to improve lung and immune function.  If you become ill and you are coughing, you will not be able to do this. Resume Coherent Breathing when you are able to do so without irritating your cough. At first you may need to start at 6 breaths per minute and work down to breaths per minute. Wash hands frequently. Use disinfectants to clean surfaces. Avoid touching your face because that is a common way the viruses are transferred from your fingers. Keep a small bottle of disinfectant with you to use after you have touched surfaces in public places that may have been contaminated.
If you choose to wear a mask, be sure it is rated as N95 anti-viral.Avoid unnecessary social gatherings, especially in closed spaces. Do not share foods or platters. Minimize travel.We cannot predict the course of coronaviruses, but we can take common sense precautions. Contact your doctor if you have any symptoms such as fever or coughing, or if you think you have been exposed.We hope that you and your families stay healthy through this difficult time.",0
"Can Herbal Medicines Fight Wuhan Coronavirus?Research over the past two decades shows that certain herbal medicines can fight the new Wuhan coronavirus contagion. Let’s review the evidence showing that certain plant medicines can fight similar viral infections such as SARS, MERS and Ebola, and why this can also apply to the Wuhan coronavirus, Let’s review some of the current science on this coronavirus infection. Then we can discuss what plant medicines can offer.A unique collection of 33 plant lectins with different specificities were evaluated. The plant lectins possessed marked antiviral properties against both coronaviruses with EC(50) values in the lower microgram/ml range (middle nanomolar range), being non-toxic (CC(50)) at 50-100 microg/ml. The strongest anti-coronavirus activity was found predominantly among the mannose-binding lectins.Of the 33 plants tested, 15 extracts inhibited replication of both coronaviruses. Those antiviral lectins were successful in inhibiting the replication of the viruses.The 15 coronavirus-inhibiting plants were:Amaryllis (Hippeastrum hybrid), Snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis), Daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus), Red spider lily (Lycoris radiate), Leek (Allium porrum), Ramsons (Allium ursinum), Taro (Colocasia esculenta), Cymbidium orchid (Cymbidium hybrid), Twayblade (Listera ovata), Broad-leaved helleborine (Epipactis helleborine), Tulip (Tulipa hybrid), Black mulberry tree (Morus Nigra), Tabacco plant (Nicotiana tabacum), Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)",0
"It started with a light cough. He burped constantly, and complained of shortness of breath. Family members thought it was no big deal. The doctor said he seemed to have heart problems and suggested him to stay in the hospital. He appeared healthy except for a minor infection in one lung area.Two weeks later, he was dead, with both lungs infected and organ failure. His doctors at the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital determined the cause of death as “unknown pneumonia.” It was days before Chinese health authorities identified the cause of the new viral pneumonia as 2019-nCoV, a coronavirus that first emerged in December in the commercial city of Wuhan, his home city.This is a deadly virus, more deadly so far than the worst viral threats to date and they are locking people up in their own homes in China. For all the latest information see this video. Things are moving fast and events are looking to overtake the world’s health officials, who this time are being aggressive in trying to control it, at least in China.Brandon Smith writes, “I would not be surprised if we discover in the next two weeks that the death tally is in the thousands, and the sickness rate is actually in the hundreds of thousands. The fact that China has now quarantined over 50 million people in 16 cities suggests the danger is much higher than they have admitted. If this is the case, then at the very least, the Chinese economy is about to take a massive hit. If the virus doesn’t spread, the economic damage will.”The official number of those infected by the Wuhan Coronaviris (2019-nCoV) now stands at almost 8,000, according to the latest Johns Hopkins CSSE data (already a figure rivaling the 2003 SARS outbreak), with the total number of deaths now standing at 170 (both figures up 29% on the day before). Untold thousands are struggling with the virus in hospitals in China, whose government is promising to build a 1,000 bed hospital in one week in Wuhan.It is highly doubtful, the way things are looking, that even if they lock down all the major cities of the world they are not going to control it, but they will do their best to control us. It is already a matter of too little too late and they still are not advising doctors or the public what simple but powerful things people can do to minimize chances of it going critical demanding ICU care. People are dying from the regular flu but if you get the coronavirus you chances of dying are going to be much greater. Believe me you do not want your loved ones to die of the flu this year.This virus is severe, and with flu season in the northern hemisphere in full swing, it is going to be difficult, if you just are coming down with the feelings of the flu, to determine if you have the new coronavirus, or just regular flu, which can also kill you if you are not careful. Coronaviruses are a class of common viruses, causing everything from the common cold to epidemics like severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars).Dr. Grayson also said, “Having YEARS of experience developing an Ebola treatment, I was concerned about this Coronavirus Outbreak from the outset, because this coronavirus strain is very contagious, causes severe illness, and NO treatments or vaccines are available.” Well that’s an admission that he knows of no treatments, or the government has no certified treatment, but that does not mean there are no treatments.Approximately 50% lived through Ebola even though patient were not receiving treatment since doctors did not believe there was a treatment. They are saying the same about the coronavirus and that is completely absurd. There are many strong things one can do to increase the chances of surviving viral infections. If you believe there is little or nothing to do, which is what doctors and health organizations believe, that is exactly what you and they will continue to do, even if it means literally adding to the death rate because of limiting beliefs.Doctors get hysterical about viruses because they refused to learn about, and use, the best and safest treatments for their patients. For example, as early as June 1, 1905 an article was printed in the New York Times[1] about the successful use of iodine for consumption/tuberculosis. Though iodine kills most pathogens on the skin within 90 seconds, its use as an antibiotic/antiviral/antifungal has been completely ignored by modern medicine so we do not hear one word about it as the coronavirus spreads.Iodine exhibits activity against bacteria, molds, yeasts, protozoa, and many viruses; indeed, of all antiseptic preparations suitable for direct use on humans and animals and upon tissues, only iodine is capable of killing all classes of pathogens: gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, yeasts, viruses and protozoa. Most bacteria are killed within 15 to 30 seconds of contact.With iodine in your pocket you don’t have to worry so much about viral infections if you know how to use it effectively. “Extremely high doses of iodine can have serious side effects, but only a small fraction of such extreme doses are necessary to kill influenza viruses,” writes Dr. David Derry of Canada. In 1945, a breakthrough occurred when Dr. J.D. Stone and Sir McFarland Burnet (who later went on to win a Nobel Prize for his Clonal Selection Theory) exposed mice to lethal effects of influenza viral mists. The lethal disease was prevented by putting iodine solution on mice snouts just prior to placing them in chambers containing influenza viruses. Dr. Derry reminds us that a long time ago students in classrooms were protected from influenza by iodine aerosol therapy. Aerosol iodine also is effective against freshly sprayed influenza virus.Dr. David Brownstein says, “Iodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine.”Medicines To Have And Use At Home.There is a short list of medicines used in ICU departments that can be used safely at home to minimize the threat of dying from the coronavirus. Sodium bicarbonate should be stocked in the house and taken, enough so one gets everyone’s urinary pH up to being more alkaline. The body should be literally flooded with magnesium, high dosages of selenium and iodine, potassium (potassium bicarbonate) and even sulfur. Vitamin C and D can also be taken at very high dosages as they sometimes are given in the best ICU treatment centers.Brownstein says vitamin A should be added to this list. He also says, “To prevent becoming ill and to avoid having a poorly responding immune system, it is vitally important to eat a healthy diet free of all sources of refined sugar. Refined sugar has been shown to negatively alter the functioning of the white blood cells for hours after ingestion. Finally, it is important to maintain optimal hydration—drink water!”In the emergency room medicines have to be safe while delivering an instant lifesaving burst of healing power. The idea when used at home is to constantly be administering these medicinals during waking hours when suffering from the flu or the cornonavirus.The power and speed of these medicines and the flexibility of their administration methods make them ideal especially because of their extremely low-toxicity profiles. As usual the key to their use is in the dose given. (Dosages and Treatments for Cornonavirus Infections Coming Tomorrow.) Fewer people will die from the coronavirus, as from any virus, if they are treated correctly.If, God forbid, one comes down with the virus it is good to have a nebulizer on hand so you can get magnesium, iodine and bicarbonate directly into the lungs.Serious Conclusions.Brandon Smith has a lot to say about why we should all be concerned:“Global pandemic, whether a natural event or deliberately engineered, actually serves the purposes of the globalist establishment in a number of ways. First and foremost, it is a superb distraction. The general public, overcome with fears of an invisible force of nature that can possibly kill them at any moment, will probably forget all about the much bigger threat to their life, liberty and future – the subsequent collapse of the massive ‘Everything Bubble’ and the globalist “solution” that a pandemic can trigger.”“The globalist establishment has created the largest financial bubble in modern history through central bank stimulus, inflating a highly unstable artificial rally in markets while also creating new highs in national debt, corporate debt and consumer debt. The economic fundamentals have been sending alarms for the past two years, and the ‘Everything Bubble’ is showing signs of implosion. It is only a matter of time before the farce collapses by itself. The globalists need scapegoats, but they also need an event or wave of events so distracting that people will not be able to discern what really happened.”“The reason why globalists want a collapse is simple – They need crisis in order to manipulate the masses into accepting total centralization, a global monetary system and global governance. They are also rabid believers in eugenics and population reduction. At the very least, a global pandemic is a useful happenstance for them; but the timing of the coronavirus event and their highly accurate “simulation” only three months ago also suggests their potential involvement, as it comes right as the implosion of the Everything Bubble was accelerating.”",0
"Treatment Recommendations For New Virus That Is Shutting Down Entire Cities. The Headlines read: China Quarantines a City of 11 Million Over Deadly New Virus. Little is known about the new virus, making it more challenging for authorities to figure out the appropriate action to take, experts say. Unfortunately, they will not take appropriate action because they refuse to look at the fundamental weakness of all viruses, which can be easily and cheaply exploited.People die of viruses all the time but the death rates can be sharply reduced if we pull the rug out from under them with rapid changes in pH and with heavy dosages of iodine, selenium and magnesium chloride. Modern medicine refuses to look at these basic medicines, which are commonly used in ICU departments that save lives everyday; refuses to entertain the idea that these same medicines could be perfect medicines to both prevent and treat this new viral disease.
Authorities do not know the incubation period which makes it difficult to know how to respond. But we do know the virus spreads easily and quickly. The province of Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital and largest city, late Wednesday reported a total 444 confirmed cases, up from 270 announced the previous day.
The Chinese National Health Commission reported early Friday that there have been 25 deaths from and 830 cases of the coronavirus, a sharp increase. The death toll increased by more than a half-dozen in 24 hours, while the number of confirmed cases jumped by more than 200.The media and medical system do not know how to respond except to create a panic. However, even worse infections are spreading but you will not read about them in the media.There is a hushed panic playing out in hospitals around the world as a deadly fungus is spreading killing a lot of people. The fungus known as Candida Auris, kills almost half of all patients who contract it within 90 days, according to the CDC – as it’s impervious to most major anti-fungal medications. First described in 2009 after a 70-year-old Japanese woman showed up at a Tokyo hospital with C. Auris in her ear canal, the aggressive yeast infection has spread across Asia and Europe – arriving in the US by 2016.Residents inside Wuhan have reported long lines at the city’s hospitals, with some patients seeking advice or treatment waiting hours to be seen. Videos posted to social media showed tense scenes as staff tried to maintain order in jam-packed hospital corridors.Want to understand your health situation and learn what best to do to feel better?

Now we read: China extended has extended its quarantine on the city of Wuhan over a deadly virus to two more cities on Thursday, cutting off a total of almost 19 million people.“It’s Like Cancelling Christmas” – Beijing Scraps Lunar New Year Festivities Amid Virus Outbreak.The virus — which was first diagnosed less than a month ago — has already killed at least 18 people and infected more than 650 people around the world, including confirmed reports in Singapore and Saudi Arabia.One patient in Wuhan infected more than a dozen medical staff. There is one confirmed case in the US. That person arrived by plane from China. Potentially everyone on the plane could now be a carrier and we may not know for a week or more. It could be spreading around the world rapidly as many Chinese have already traveled to every continent. The following weeks will be telling.In Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China, where the new coronavirus originated, will halt all outbound flights and trains and shut down its public transportation system from Thursday morning, the Chinese government said, a dramatic escalation in China’s battle to contain a pneumonia outbreak that has now killed 17 people.Several provinces and territories in China, including Fujian, Anhui, Liaoning and Guizhou, announced their first confirmed infection cases on Wednesday, according to CCTV and local Chinese authorities.Treatments for Viral Infection.If you do not want your loved ones to die of a viral infection the first thing you need to know is that the minute you or your kids get the sniffles you have to treat aggressively with natural not pharmaceutical drugs. Better yet, the same medicines can be used to prevent infection in the first place so people interested in protecting their families from this virus (and all others) would be well advised to start treatments before, treat preemptively.We are talking about sodium bicarbonate, magnesium chloride, selenium and iodine all of which can be applied at high dosages to head viruses off at the pass before they take hold and choke a person to death. All of these medicines can be administered at home safely and legally and one does not need a prescription because they are nutritional in nature, not pharmaceutical.Susceptibility to infectious diseases is common in malnourished and toxic human populations. This has traditionally been viewed as simply a consequence of the fact that the immune system must be maintained by adequate nutrition in order to function optimally. Only recently has data begun to accumulate in support of the idea that nutritional factors may sometimes have a direct effect on pathogens, and that passage through nutritionally deficient hosts may facilitate evolutionary changes in infectious agents.Killing Viral Infections with Sodium Bicarbonate. Certain viruses (including the rhinoviruses and coronaviruses that are most often responsible for the common cold and influenza viruses that produce flu) infect host cells by fusion with cellular membranes at low pH. Thus they are classified as “pH-dependent viruses.”Fusion of viral and cellular membranes is pH dependent. “Fusion depends on the acidification of the endosomal compartment. Fusion at the endosome level is triggered by conformational changes in viral glycoproteins induced by the low pH of this cellular compartment.”“In 1918 and 1919 while fighting the ‘Flu’ with the U. S. Public Health Service it was brought to my attention that rarely anyone who had been thoroughly alkalinized with bicarbonate of soda contracted the disease, and those who did contract it, if alkalinized early, would invariably have mild attacks. I have since that time treated all cases of ‘cold,’ influenza and ‘la gripe’ by first giving generous doses of bicarbonate of soda, and in many, many instances within 36 hours the symptoms would have entirely abated,” wrote Dr. Volney S. Cheney to the Arm & Hammer Company.Dr. Jerry Tennant writes, “As oxygen levels continue to drop, you get infections. Each of us contain about a trillion “bugs”. They are suppressed when oxygen is present. However, as oxygen drops, the “bugs” wake up and want to have lunch—-they want to have you for lunch. Since they don’t have teeth to take a bite out of your cells, they put out digestive enzymes to dissolve your cells. As they consume your cells, you get sick.”The most important factor in creating proper pH is increasing oxygen because no wastes or toxins can leave the body without first combining. with oxygen. The more alkaline you are, the more oxygen your fluids can hold and keep. The position of the oxygen disassociation curve (ODC) is influenced directly by pH, core body temperature and carbon dioxide pressure. According to Warburg, it is the increased amounts of carcinogens, toxicity and pollution that cause cells to be unable to uptake oxygen efficiently.Never Forget Iodine.“Extremely high doses of iodine can have serious side effects, but only a small fraction of such extreme doses are necessary to kill influenza viruses,” writes Dr. David Derry of Canada. In 1945, a breakthrough occurred when J. D. Stone and Sir McFarland Burnet (who later went on to win a Nobel Prize for his Clonal Selection Theory) exposed mice to lethal effects of influenza viral mists. Pathology was prevented by putting iodine solution on mice snouts just prior to placing them in chambers containing influenza viruses. Dr. Derry also reminds us that a long time ago students in classrooms were protected from influenza by iodine aerosol therapy. Aerosol iodine also is effective against freshly sprayed influenza virus.Iodine is a must when dealing with deadly viruses and would go a long way in decreasing the death rate from Ebola. Dr. Gabriel Cousens wrote, “Historically, as early as 1911, people normally took between 300,000-900,000 micrograms of iodine daily without incident. Other researchers have used between 3,000 and 6,000 micrograms/day to prevent goiter.” Deficiencies in iodine have a great effect on the immune system.Vitamin D – Perfect Helpmate to Vitamin C.Vitamin D reduces the risk of dying from a viral infection. Researchers from Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, New York found that giving supplements of vitamin D to a group of volunteers reduced episodes of infection with colds and flu by 70% over three years. The researchers said that vitamin D stimulates “innate immunity” to viruses and bacteria. Very few have any idea that Vitamin D can be taken in high dosages like Vitamin C can.Magnesium for Acute Illness. Magnesium chloride (magnesium oil) has always been and remains my favorite first line medicine that affects overall physiology. Dr. Raul Vergini from Italy says, “Magnesium chloride has a unique healing power on acute viral and bacterial diseases. It cured polio and diphtheria and that was the main subject of my magnesium book. A few grams of magnesium chloride every few hours will clear nearly most acute illnesses, which can be beaten in a few hours. I have seen a lot of flu cases healed in 24-48 hours with 3 grams of magnesium chloride taken every 6-8 hours.” My recommendation would be to follow Dr. Vergini’s suggestion and augmenting that with Transdermal Magnesium Therapy. The second edition of Transsdermal Magnesium Therapy is also available in hardcopy from Amazon.com.
Selenium Medicine.Selenium deficiency may allow invading viruses to mutate and cause longer-lasting, more severe illness. Animal research has shown selenium and vitamin E have synergistic effects, enhancing the body’s response to bacterial and parasitic infections.In that selenium is a potent immune stimulator is an 18-month study of 262 patients with AIDS that found those who took a daily capsule containing 200 micrograms of selenium ended up with lower levels of the AIDS virus and more health-giving CD4 immune system cells in their bloodstreams than those taking a dummy pill.These AIDS patients who took selenium were able to suppress the deadly virus in their bodies and boost their fragile immune systems, adding to evidence that selenium has healing powers that should be employed for all viral threats.The clinical investigations in sepsis studies indicate that higher doses of selenium are well tolerated as continuous infusions of selenium as sodium selenite (4,000 μg selenium as sodium selenite pentahydrat on the first day, 1,000 μg selenium/day on the nine following days) and had no reported toxicity issues. In view of this new information, Biosyn introduced the 1,000 µg dose vials for such high selenium clinical usage.Using Sunlight to Ramp Up Immune Response.Sunlight Offers Surprise Benefit, It Energizes Infection Fighting T Cells reads the headlines. Georgetown University Medical Center researchers have found that sunlight, through a mechanism separate than vitamin D production, energizes T cells that play a central role in human immunity.Professor Gerard Ahern, who lead the study at Georgetown said, “We all know sunlight provides vitamin D, which is suggested to have an impact on immunity, among other things. “But what we found is a completely separate role of sunlight on immunity. Some of the roles attributed to vitamin D on immunity may be due to this new mechanism.”One of the greatest triggers of influenza, the swine flu and deaths from pulmonary deficiency is vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D reduces the risk of dying from all causes including the flu. Researchers from Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, New York found that giving supplements of vitamin D to a group of volunteers reduced episodes of infection with colds and flu by 70% over three years. The researchers said that the vitamin stimulated “innate immunity” to viruses and bacteria. Very few have any idea that Vitamin D can be taken in extremely high dosages like Vitamin C can.When our immune system is already depressed, we die more easily when confronted with infection. Emerging viruses are becoming more virile and aggressive, and traditional medications are becoming less effective against them. Viruses are smart, mutating and becoming resistant to antiviral pharmaceuticals.

"As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China. At present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal coronavirus, so that identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Three general methods, which include existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs using standard assays, screening of a chemical library containing many existing compounds or databases, and the redevelopment of new specific drugs based on the genome and biophysical understanding of individual coronaviruses, are used to discover the potential antiviral treatment of human pathogen coronavirus. Lopinavir /Ritonavir, Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1), arbidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese traditional medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be the drug treatment options for 2019-nCoV. However, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019- nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical experiments.",0

"As coronavirus has ripped across the globe, a new conspiracy theory has found an eager audience: that the symptoms of the virus - high fever, coughing and shortness of breath - are actually the human body responding to exposure to 5G.Anti-5G critics based in the UK accept the virus likely began in a market in Wuhan and travelled here through human transmission. But they bizarrely believe the 5G networks helps the spread of the virus.But they're concerned the ultra-fast network currently operating in almost 100 locations around Britain could be helping it to spread more quickly, despite a lack of scientific proof to stand up their unfounded claims.Activist Louise Thomas, based in Somerset, told Daily Star Online: ""We can't say 5G has caused the coronavirus, but it might be exacerbating it.""Tanja Rebel, another activist and philosophy lecturer at the Isle of Wight College, told us: ""Many studies show that Electro-Magnetic Radiation (EMR) suppresses the immune system and that it helps viruses and bacteria thrive.""So EMR and in particular 5G could act as an accelerator for the disease. We do not know for sure, but common sense and the precautionary principle decree that we urgently need a moratorium on the roll-out of 5G until we can show that it is safe.""Very little is known about Covid-19, the novel coronavirus at the heart of the current pandemic, but research has shown that viruses ""talk to each other"" when making decisions about infecting a host.Activists are now calling for the government to put a stop to the 5G rollout in what they believe to be the interests of public health, despite repeated assurances from experts that the network radiation poses no threat.""Especially in today's situation it is paramount that we do not play further with lives,"" Rebel said.

"Over the past few days, the mainstream press has vigorously pushed back against a theory about the origins of the coronavirus that has now infected as many as 70,000+ people in Wuhan alone (depending on whom you believe). The theory is that China obtained the coronavirus via a Canadian research program, and started molding it into a bioweapon at the Institute of Virology in Wuhan. Politifact pointed the finger at Zero Hedge, in particular, though the story was widely shared across independent-leaning media.The theory is that the virus, which was developed by infectious disease experts may have originated in the Wuhan-based lab of Dr. Peng Zhou, China's preeminent researcher of bat immune systems, specifically in how their immune systems adapt to the presence of viruses like coronavirus and other destructive viruses. Somehow, the virus escaped from the lab, and the Hunan fish market where the virus supposedly originated is merely a ruse.Now, a respected epidemiologist who recently caught flack for claiming in a twitter threat that the virus appeared to be much more contagious than initially believed is pointing out irregularities in the virus's genome that suggests it might have been genetically engineered for the purposes of a weapon, and not just any weapon but the deadliest one of all.In ""Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag"", Indian researchers are baffled by segments of the virus's RNA that have no relation to other coronaviruses like SARS, and instead appear to be closer to HIV. The virus even responds to treatment by HIV medications.For those pressed for time, here are the key findings from the paper, which first focuses on the unique nature of 2019-nCoV, and then observe four amino acid sequences in the Wuhan Coronavirus which are homologous to amino acid sequences in HIV1:In addition, other recent studies have linked the 2019-nCoV to SARS CoV. We therefore compared the spike glycoprotein sequences of the 2019-nCoV to that of the SARS CoV (NCBI Accession number: AY390556.1). On careful examination of the sequence alignment we found that the 2019- nCoV spike glycoprotein contains 4 insertions [Fig.2]. To further investigate if these inserts are present in any other corona virus, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the spike glycoprotein amino acid sequences of all available coronaviruses (n=55) [refer Table S.File1] in NCBI refseq (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) this includes one sequence of 2019-nCoV[Fig.S1]. We found that these 4 insertions [inserts 1, 2, 3 and 4] are unique to 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses analyzed. Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses . Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses (Zhou et al., 2020).We then translated the aligned genome and found that these inserts are present in all Wuhan 2019-nCoV viruses except the 2019-nCoV virus of Bat as a host [Fig.S4]. Intrigued by the 4 highly conserved inserts unique to 2019-nCoV we wanted to understand their origin. For this purpose, we used the 2019-nCoV local alignment with each insert as query against all virus genomes and considered hits with 100% sequence coverage. Surprisingly, each of the four inserts aligned with short segments of the Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) proteins. The amino acid positions of the inserts in 2019-nCoV and the corresponding residues in HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 Gag are shown in Table 1.The first 3 inserts (insert 1,2 and 3) aligned to short segments of amino acid residues in HIV-1 gp120. The insert 4 aligned to HIV-1 Gag. The insert 1 (6 amino acid residues) and insert 2 (6 amino acid residues) in the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV are 100% identical to the residues mapped to HIV-1 gp120. The insert 3 (12 amino acid residues) in 2019- nCoV maps to HIV-1 gp120 with gaps [see Table 1]. The insert 4 (8 amino acid residues) maps to HIV-1 Gag with gaps.Why do the authors think the virus may be man-made? Because when looking at the above insertions which are not present in any of the closest coronavirus families, ""it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time."" Instead, they can be found in cell identification and membrane binding proteins located in the HIV genome.Since the S protein of 2019-nCoV shares closest ancestry with SARS GZ02, the sequence coding for spike proteins of these two viruses were compared using MultiAlin software. We found four new insertions in the protein of 2019-nCoV- “GTNGTKR” (IS1), “HKNNKS” (IS2), “GDSSSG” (IS3) and “QTNSPRRA” (IS4) (Figure 2). To our surprise, these sequence insertions were not only absent in S protein of SARS but were also not observed in any other member of the Coronaviridae family (Supplementary figure). This is startling as it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time.
The insertions were observed to be present in all the genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV virus available from the recent clinical isolates. To know the source of these insertions in 2019-nCoV a local alignment was done with BLASTp using these insertions as query with all virus genome. Unexpectedly, all the insertions got aligned with Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1). Further analysis revealed that aligned sequences of HIV-1 with 2019-nCoV were derived from surface glycoprotein gp120 (amino acid sequence positions: 404-409, 462-467, 136-150) and from Gag protein (366-384 amino acid) (Table 1). Gag protein of HIV is involved in host membrane binding, packaging of the virus and for the formation of virus-like particles. Gp120 plays crucial role in recognizing the host cell by binding to the primary receptor CD4.This binding induces structural rearrangements in GP120, creating a high affinity binding site for a chemokine co-receptor like CXCR4 and/or CCR5.
And some visuals, which lead the paper authors to conclude that ""this structural change might have also increased the range of host cells that 2019-nCoV can infect"":3D modelling of the protein structure displayed that these insertions are present at the binding site of 2019-nCoV. Due to the presence of gp120 motifs in 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein at its binding domain, we propose that these motif insertions could have provided an enhanced affinity towards host cell receptors. Further, this structural change might have also increased the range of host cells that 2019-nCoV can infect. To the best of our knowledge, the function of these motifs is still not clear in HIV and need to be explored. The exchange of genetic material among the viruses is well known and such critical exchange highlights the risk and the need to investigate the relations between seemingly unrelated virus families.A good recap of the findings was provided by Dr. Feigl-Ding, who started his explanatory thread by pointing out that the transmission rate outside China has surpassed the rate inside China.But the 'smoking gun' in this case are pieces of the virus's genetic code that Indian researchers, led by Prashant Pradhan at the Indian Institute of Technology, found may have been 'embedded' from HIV, which belongs to an entirely different family of viruses.",0

"The new fifth generation (5G) cellular system that is being installed in major American cities such as Dallas, Atlanta, Waco, Texas, and Sacramento [1, 3] will intensify the microwave radiation health risks for everyone living in those cities.Eleven More Cities Targeted for 5G Deployment this Year.The new 5G cell systems that Verizon and AT&T are planning to install in other cities in 2018 [1, 3] will use shorter length microwaves than the existing 4G (fourth generation) systems. New generation cell phones will be able to communicate with either 5G or 4G microwave towers to optimize connectivity. Copper phone lines will be replaced with 5G rooftop antennas on homes and businesses. These antennas will communicate with 5G cell towers and with the wireless equipment in homes and offices to provide phone and broadband services.5G will be the foundation for the “smart cities” of the future.The Safety of 5G Has Not Been Tested.The microwave frequencies that are being used in this new generation 5G system are in the 1-millimeter wave length.The long-term health risks of these short microwaves have not been adequately tested and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and telecom companies are simply presuming that they are safe based on 1996 research.New Research Reveals Harmful Effects of Cellular Systems. Research on microwave frequency radiation conducted since 1996 shows that the existing 3G and 4G cellular systems are causing serious harm to human health.The 5G systems will increase the level of harm to the level where illness and death can no longer be denied.Harmful Effects are Cumulative.We now know that the development of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and numerous other diseases and disabling symptoms are linked to the cumulative effects of microwave radiation.Cellular systems are pushing microwave radiation into our bodies and brains 24 hours a day regardless of whether we use a cell phone or even own one. A Million or More New 5G Towers will be Erected in American Cities. The 5G towers will be spaced approximately 500 feet apart and will be highly visible eyesores.The “small cell” transmitters will be mounted on top of electric utility poles, municipal buildings, schools, and in city parks, on top of street signs, bus shelters, and anywhere else telecom companies wish.n low lying areas they might need to erect new towers that are taller than electric utility poles to accomplish their objectives. Refrigerator size electrical boxes will be attached to each transmission tower. If you happen to be in an area with underground electric service, then they will erect new towers that use the underground electrical lines.If you live or work in a densely populated area where electrical poles are very close to buildings, then you might have a 5G cell tower located a few feet from your place of employment or your bedroom. It is estimated that the daily microwave exposure generated by the 5G system will be equivalent to living inside a microwave oven and turning it up to high and baking yourself for 19 minutes a day.Telecom Companies Hold the Upper Hand on 5G Tower Placement. FCC regulations [11] make it illegal for government entities to try to delay or stop cell tower installation on the basis of health risks.Telecom companies can sue cities and states that attempt to use health concerns to impede their cell tower building plans.

"Fear is one of the most powerful tools the elites have at their disposal. Using the mainstream media, politicians and others who want world domination can inject fear into the public at the drop of a hat, making them easy to manipulate and control.Aristotle once said: “He who has overcome his fears will truly be free.” Fear is a powerful weapon, and it’s been used globally for the past few months.  People have shown that the instant the media tells them to live a life scared in their homes, they will comply in order to “stay safe.” Whether the virus is real or not, is not the point.  The elitists must keep the public in a constant state of panic in order to control them. Unafraid and compassionate people are impossible to control.Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, the propaganda was injected into schools to eliminate critical thinking.At school, we were taught to think in certain ways. They taught us what to think, but not how to develop our thinking. And everyone was taught the same. If we thought in different ways than our classmates, teachers would tell us we are bad students. They would give us bad grades and might even expel us from school. Therefore, as students we learned to compromise our thinking so as to get away with trouble. –The Bounded Spirit.The other hard truth most will not like to hear is that if you are still stuck in the left vs. right paradigm, you still haven’t figured any of it out yet. Left vs. right only exists to give us the illusion of choice.  It’s time to question what we’ve been programmed to think, and it should start there. The fear of not electing the right candidate drives people to polls to vote for evil every year. (The lesser of two evils is still evil.) Politicians are being elected by persuading the masses through the use of fear while journalists influence public opinion by terrorizing people’s minds.Fear is the best weapon of all great manipulators. It can move people to do anything, no matter how nonsensical it is.  Take, for example, the COVID-19 scam.  People are still terrified of a virus that even the government has admitted isn’t any worse than the flu.  Why? Because the media, the government’s lapdog, is telling them they still need to be afraid. The elites have learned to manipulate the public’s emotions to their advantage. With global media corporations in place, controlled and operated BY the elite, they can amplify that fear quite easily. Turn on the news, open a newspaper and you’ll see this.We have been taught to be distrustful of the mind, however, and of our thoughts. This has been by design and has been perpetuated through society by the elite of this world who understand the power of thought and the nature of the mind. In fact, most of us have been through a long period of mind-programming since we were born to separate our mind from itself so that it does not know or experience this truth. –With One Breath.Obey. That is the name of the game of control. And controlled you are if you do not recognize how innately powerful, creative, and safe you really are. This life is not all you are, but it is everything you’ve been taught to believe.Our emotions are energy and they all have a frequency. The closer you are to the bottom, the easier it will be to manipulate you into obeying and complying with tyranny.“‘I’m more powerful than them and they KNOW IT.’ And within minutes of the interview ending, they were proving me right. Here they are, this cult that I will explain, that control the mainstream media, my God, has that been any more obvious than in the last few weeks?” -SHTFPlan (the video in this article has been deleted and this article has been shadowbanned.Icke was discussing the easy way to beat “the cult” as he calls it, the elitists, the government, the establishment, the ones who want to control you and enslave you.

"In January of 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $10 billion pledge to usher in a decade of vaccines. But far from an unalloyed good, the truth is that this attempt to reorient the global health economy was part of a much bigger agenda.An agenda that would ultimately lead to greater profits for big pharma companies, greater control for the Gates Foundation over the field of global health, and greater power for Bill Gates to shape the course of the future for billions of people around the planet.",0
"Vaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft’s ambition to control a global vaccination ID enterprise) and give him dictatorial control of global health policy.Gates’ obsession with vaccines seems to be fueled by a conviction to save the world with technology.Promising his share of $450 million of $1.2 billion to eradicate Polio, Gates took control of India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) which mandated up to 50 doses (Table 1) of polio vaccines through overlapping immunization programs to children before the age of five. Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) epidemic that paralyzed 490,000 children beyond expected rates between 2000 and 2017. In 2017, the Indian government dialed back Gates’ vaccine regimen and asked Gates and his vaccine policies to leave India. NPAFP rates dropped precipitously.The most frightening [polio] epidemics in Congo, Afghanistan, and the Philippines, are all linked to vaccines.
In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reluctantly admitted that the global explosion in polio is predominantly vaccine strain. The most frightening epidemics in Congo, Afghanistan, and the Philippines, are all linked to vaccines. In fact, by 2018, 70% of global polio cases were vaccine strain.In 2014, the Gates Foundation funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines, developed by Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) and Merck, on 23,000 young girls in remote Indian provinces. Approximately 1,200 suffered severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders. Seven died. Indian government investigations charged that Gates-funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls. The case is now in the country’s Supreme Court.South African newspapers complained, ‘We are guinea pigs for the drug makers.’In 2010, the Gates Foundation funded a phase 3 trial of GSK’s experimental malaria vaccine, killing 151 African infants and causing serious adverse effects including paralysis, seizure, and febrile convulsions to 1,048 of the 5,949 children.During Gates’ 2002 MenAfriVac campaign in Sub-Saharan Africa, Gates’ operatives forcibly vaccinated thousands of African children against meningitis. Approximately 50 of the 500 children vaccinated developed paralysis. South African newspapers complained, “We are guinea pigs for the drug makers.” Nelson Mandela’s former Senior Economist, Professor Patrick Bond, describes Gates’ philanthropic practices as “ruthless and immoral.”In 2010, Gates committed $10 billion to the WHO saying, “We must make this the decade of vaccines.” A month later, Gates said in a Ted Talk that new vaccines “could reduce population”. In 2014, Kenya’s Catholic Doctors Association accused the WHO of chemically sterilizing millions of unwilling Kenyan women with a  “tetanus” vaccine campaign. Independent labs found a sterility formula in every vaccine tested. After denying the charges, WHO finally admitted it had been developing the sterility vaccines for over a decade.  Similar accusations came from Tanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico, and the Philippines.A 2017 study (Morgenson et. al. 2017) showed that WHO’s popular DTP vaccine is killing more African children than the diseases it prevents. DTP-vaccinated girls suffered 10x the death rate of children who had not yet received the vaccine. WHO has refused to recall the lethal vaccine which it forces upon tens of millions of African children annually.[Global public health officials] say he has diverted agency resources to serve his personal philosophy that good health only comes in a syringe.Global public health advocates around the world accuse Gates of steering WHO’s agenda away from the projects that are proven to curb infectious diseases: clean water, hygiene, nutrition, and economic development. The Gates Foundation only spends about $650 million of its $5 billion dollar budget on these areas.  They say he has diverted agency resources to serve his personal philosophy that good health only comes in a syringe.In addition to using his philanthropy to control WHO, UNICEF, GAVI, and PATH, Gates funds a private pharmaceutical company that manufactures vaccines, and additionally is donating $50 million to 12 pharmaceutical companies to speed up development of a coronavirus vaccine. In his recent media appearances, Gates appears confident that the Covid-19 crisis will now give him the opportunity to force his dictatorial vaccine programs on American children.",0
"In October of 2012, this website ran a story about Bill Gates’ eugenicist tendencies, citing video clips of him publicly talking about the need to bring more vaccinations to the world and how this would make it possible to reduce population growth.We’ve since run many stories on Gates’ pursuits to have an impact on the world, including discussing the idea that a global pandemic would present the perfect opportunity to rollout mandatory vaccines.Here is the quote from Gates at that time:“Over this decade, we believe unbelievable progress can be made, both inventing new vaccines and making sure they get to all the children that need them… We could cut the number of children who die every year from about 9 million to half of that if we have success on it… The benefits are in terms of reducing sickness, reducing the population growth. It really allows a society a chance to take care of itself once you’ve made that intervention.”
A key word in the above quote is ‘intervention,’ and now that we’re in the throes of the global coronavirus pandemic, we see Gates making regular appearances for mainstream audiences such as with Trevor Noah on The Daily Show, and CBS This Morning with Anthony Mason. His message is consistent: a new vaccine is the only thing that can allow us to continue our lives.Gates is unashamedly a health interventionist, which is not entirely unlike the military interventionist.
Both believe they are gifted with a superior sense of what is right and wrong, and both believe that providence has put them in a position of power so that they may improve upon the world. They do not concern themselves with collateral damage.In the years since Gates’s above comments, a frustrating impasse has emerged for the cause of vaccination: When given the choice, a lot of people choose not take vaccinations.You see, people began wondering what possible side-effects and negative effects vaccines were having on children.People started to question the motives and practices of the pharmaceutical companies who were creating these for profit products.People began to wonder what influence these same companies had on representatives of our democracy and how this influence was shaping public vaccination policy.People began wondering how the influence of pharmaceutical company advertising dollars was influencing the national media and the public conversation over vaccine safety.People began to wonder why these same vaccine manufacturers were granted federal legal immunity from any harm their products may cause, a privilege not known by any other industry.Naturally, the result of all this questioning was that people began to make informed decisions out of concern for their well-being.Many people who looked into this all decided to go ahead with vaccinations.Many people decided to opt-out, and as information about this issue spread, the numbers of those opting-out grew, and continues to grow.So now we have open censorship of vaccine adverse reaction information. Individuals and organizations who champion the cause of vaccine safety on behalf of children and parents who’ve experienced vaccine harm are demonized and demonetized.But children are not dying en masse of diseases for which vaccines have been invented. And people are still refusing vaccinations. And people are still opting out of vaccines.And the policy of influencing world population through the use of vaccinations doesn’t work when people don’t take the vaccines.
So laws began to change as well. Vaccine exemptions were attacked and removed, school systems began demanding more vaccines for students and kicking children out of school if their parents had opted-out.The tenor from government on this has become increasingly authoritarian.So now we have a global pandemic.And while there is no consensus on the origin of the virus, no consensus on what constitutes a death from Covid-19, no consensus on how many strains of this virus are already circulating, no consensus on how the official numbers are compiled, and no push to improve public health by suggesting anti-viral products or proper-nutrition, or anything other than vaccines, we have Bill Gates telling us that to get our life back, to work, to participate in community,  we’ll have to take a brand new Covid-19 vaccine.Here he is in his own words:“In which activities like mass gatherings, uh, may be, in a certain sense, more optional, and so until you’re widely vaccinated those may not, uh, come back, uh, at all.” ~Bill Gates. We will not be allowed to have mass gatherings unless we’ve taken a Covid-19 vaccine?
Does this sound optional to you?This really is just the tip of the iceberg, as Gates has made a slew of similar statements in recent weeks. Truthstream Media just did an excellent presentation on this.If you’re at all less than interested in being required to have a vaccine in order to regain your personal freedom, now would be a good time to speak up about it.By the way, since 2012 we’ve run a number of stories, as have other news outlets, highlighting Gates’ projects to influence world health through the invention of vaccines and technologies giving more control over your health to bureaucracies.",0
"By now it is no secret the World Health Organization and the United Nations are among the many organizations funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
In previous reports we have extensively documented Gates’ global vaccination programs and their connections to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals under the 2030 Agenda.In this report, we document how Bill Gates is not only working to fulfill the UN’s global vaccine program, but how Gates is also working to take control of the food supply chain globally, a long-desired achievement of the UN.Also find out about the mandatory vaccination policy being kept under wraps in addition to another Gates-funded venture to blanket the earth with real-time surveillance from space.",0
"Bill Gates and food giant Tyson heavily backed lab grown meat research.As the United States faces unprecedented meat shortages due to processing plants going offline in response to the coronavirus, a long-standing globalist agenda to halt meat consumption is being fulfilled.Tyson foods recently warned that the food supply chain is “breaking.”Lockdowns have created a situation in which farmers have nowhere to send their product, and in turn millions of animals are being slaughtered. Additionally, vegetables that would normally end up on store shelves are rotting in the field.Despite this reality, Twitter has announced that talk of food shortages will be censored.Lab grown meat producers are hoping that the COVID-19 outbreak could boost public acceptance.

"Those who have read Naomi Klein’s seminal book The Shock Doctrine will remember how the ‘short sharp shock’ (primarily economic) was the tool fashioned by the Chicago School of Economics in order to create regime change in countries that resisted US hegemonic power grabs in the 1980s and 1990s.This neocolonial heist was administered to a number of South American countries, in the Middle East and also in Eastern Europe, where, in 1989, Poland’s Solidarity movement was undermined by the Chicago School’s Jeffrey Sachs posing as a libertarian anti-communist bringer of gifts from the West.A poisoned chalice, as it turned out, as Sachs infiltrated the hugely popular worker-led new political movement known as The Third Way and landed Poland with a draconian IMF loan whose repayment terms wrecked the country’s industrial base.A very similar scenario was repeated in Greece whose people are still struggling at the hands of the same treatment meated-out by The European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank, collectively known as The Troika.
Now ‘The Shock Doctrine’ is back with us again – with a vengeance. But this time it’s not just a national shock prescription, but a global one, executed on the concocted premise of a dangerous virus which is purported to have escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, at the turn of the year.
The first move of this latest attempted grand heist has been to get around half the population locked-down in their own homes and induced into a state of fear paralysis. A formula that is activated by the ‘instructed’ mainstream media spreading a panic-warning of said virus spooking its way into all avenues of life and causing some form of untreatable sickness.The effectiveness of this fear-based indoctrination programme has been remarkable. A recent national opinion poll conducted in the UK suggests that more than 60% of the British public – believing what they are hearing and consequently suffering the Covid fear symptoms – do not want the lockdown measures to be lifted or even eased. This might be explained by the fact that the BBC – a masterful spreader of political disinformation – is regarded by many in the UK as ‘god’, followed closely by the Queen, on whose estate the Pirbright Institute is housed, a Coronavirus patent is officially registered and a Covid-19 vaccine is being developed.The tactics currently being deployed rely upon deliberate deception, preplanned social engineering and applied behavioural psychology being trained on great swathes of the world population via a completely compliant media which works hand in hand with a corporate/banker/political cabal whose sights are set on nothing less than totalitarian control of all avenues of human society as well as of the human brain.As long as actions taken in relation to the grand Covid scam can continue to be sold as a genuine attempt to protect citizens, rather than screw them, the lockdown can be largely kept in place, enabling the implementation of a rapid desecration of the fundamental constitutional rights of citizens living in what are claimed to be ‘democratic’ countries.But as soon as a critical mass see through the veil and cease to buy the lie, the tables will be turned; an event likely to lead to a showdown between a steadily emerging recognition of truth and a rapidly fracturing ‘fortress lie’. Our job at this moment of time is to catalyse this process.Notwithstanding the fact that any and all preventable premature deaths carry with them a real sense of loss, the outrageous absurdity of pretending that the release of a virus recognised to be a strain of common flu, should constitute a valid reason for wrecking billions of people’s lives and income sources, from one end of the world to the other, has got to be revealed for what it is: an act of preplanned genocide.Enough time has passed and enough evidence accrued to know that the death toll ascribed to Covid-19 – as farcically imprecise as the statistics are – is less than the average loss of life brought about by the standard annual winter flu cycle in Northern hemisphere countries – and just a fraction of the deaths resulting from cancer, heart disease and the other major sicknesses to which modern man typically succumbs.So instead of pouring over oceans of epidemiological evidence as though training to acquire a PhD in virology, we need to turn to face the enemy and take direct action to halt the advance of the lie machine. Studying the small details of exactly what forms the constituent parts of this particular strain of sickness, is a deviation we cannot afford to indulge in. Let specialist doctors get on with this; but let the rest of us jump to our feet and slam closed the oak door that protects our most fundamental freedoms from being eviscerated right in front of our eyes.Doctors, recognising that they are being deeply misled about the nature of this so called ‘pandemic’ must refuse to go along with the lies. They should form their own informal committees in which to share their knowledge and help those in need using best practices and common sense. Thousands are in danger of breaking the Hippocratic Oath by following directives that defy logic and rational thought.
Within the legal profession, let all those who retain some human judgement demand that an immediate emergency injunction be tabled in the high court of law in their country; leading to a court order being issued against all attempts to change national constitutions and other legal acts ‘on the hoof’ without any proper debate or opportunity for those under attack to put their case and defend their lawful rights.Let all those who work in communications and media recognise that they carry a moral and ethical responsibility to do more than simply pass on a purely superficial repetition of what it is they are on hand to report. All too often journalists today act like robots – without ever exploring and reporting on the deeper issues that lie behind significant news events. Editors are equally culpable, if not more so. Both tend to land-up as hired hands to billionaires and bought-out governments.May such individuals now wake-up to the realisation that they have a duty to inform the general public of whether those whose statements they report are acting in the interests or in abuse of the health and welfare of the greater public they are supposed to serve.Journalists of all descriptions have a vital role to perform at this time. If acting responsibly means getting kicked-out of one’s job – so be it – one will at least regain a blessedly clear conscience and win the opportunity to club together with other members of the resistance, to form real and much needed new avenues of independent communication, thereby conveying words of enlightenment rather than being complicit in the further dumbing-down of fellow human beings.
Teachers; stop forcing locked-down children to sit behind computer screens for hours at a time. The harm this is doing far outweighs the value of the teaching and lands parents with the task of acting as psychologists for their own distracted children. This torture must cease, as indeed must all thoughtless compliance with State educational programmes.To all those who are in any degree enlightened, regardless of what profession, job or other diverse interest one may feel aligned with – now is the time to rally to the cause.  The cause of saving families, friends and communities from being enslaved by what has increasingly shown itself to be a despotic, sinister and ruthless cabal fully intent on destroying the rule of law and replacing it with a fascistic police state. It’s no good hiding one’s head in the sand and praying it will never come to this. It already has – and we have to act accordingly.",0
"Could dissidents potentially be electronically blacklisted and denied access to cashless payment systems and transit systems as if they were a banned web page in the ‘internet of things’?A sobering reality has emerged since this report was published. The infrastructure for this system of control has been built.
The 5G network will enable the rollout of a vast command and control grid that will monitor people, places and things wirelessly in real-time. Humans will not have the ability to opt out and live a normal life.The Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure will be organized by the 5G network. Trillions of objects made “smart” by embedded computer chips will be “alive” in the grid.In 2012, CIA Director David Petraeus said that the technology will be “transformational… particularly to their effect on clandestine tradecraft“. Petraeus explained:Items of interest will be located, identified, monitored, and remotely controlled through technologies such as radio-frequency identification, sensor networks, tiny embedded servers, and energy harvesters – all connected to the next-generation internet using abundant, low-cost, and high-power computing.
The UK Ministry of Defense said in a 2010 report that a vast surveillance network would overtake the planet:The virtual networks will consist of communications servers linking individuals and objects, many of which will be networked through individual Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.Ultimately, as stated in the paper, it may become difficult to “turn the outside world off,” and “…Even amongst those who make an explicit life-style choice to remain detached, choosing to be disconnected may be considered suspicious behaviour.”As coronavirus accelerates trends toward automation through robotics and artificial intelligence,rapid adoption of 5G can be expected as well.The monumental shift to this anti-human system will not happen without resistance.",0
"Technology developed by the Pentagon’s controversial research branch is getting a huge boost amid the current coronavirus crisis, with little attention going to the agency’s ulterior motives for developing said technologies, their potential for weaponization or their unintended consequences.In January, well before the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis would result in lockdowns, quarantines and economic devastation in the United States and beyond, the U.S. intelligence community and the Pentagon were working with the National Security Council to create still-classified plans to respond to an imminent pandemic. It has since been alleged that the intelligence and military intelligence communities knew about a likely pandemic in the United States as early as last November, and potentially even before then.Given this foreknowledge and the numerous simulations conducted in the United States last year regarding global viral pandemic outbreaks, at least six of varying scope and size, it has often been asked – Why did the government not act or prepare if an imminent global pandemic and the shortcomings of any response to such an event were known? Though the answer to this question has frequently been written off as mere “incompetence” in mainstream media circles, it is worth entertaining the possibility that a crisis was allowed to unfold.Why would the intelligence community or another faction of the U.S. government knowingly allow a crisis such as this to occur? The answer is clear if one looks at history, as times of crisis have often been used by the U.S. government to implement policies that would normally be rejected by the American public, ranging from censorship of the press to mass surveillance networks. Though the government response to the September 11 attacks, like the Patriot Act, may be the most accessible example to many Americans, U.S. government efforts to limit the flow of “dangerous” journalism and surveil the population go back to as early as the First World War. Many of these policies, whether the Patriot Act after 9/11 or WWI-era civilian “spy” networks, did little if anything to protect the homeland, but instead led to increased surveillance and control that persisted long after the crisis that spurred them had ended.Using this history as a lens, it is possible to look at the current coronavirus crisis to see how the long-standing agendas of ever-expanding mass surveillance and media censorship are again getting a dramatic boost thanks to the chaos unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic. Yet, this crisis is unique because it also has given a boost to a newer yet complimentary agenda that — if fulfilled – would render most, if not all, other government efforts at controlling and subduing their populations obsolete.DARPA Dystopia. For years, the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has remained largely out of sight and out of mind for most Americans, as their research projects are rarely covered by the mainstream media and, when they are, their projects are often praised as “bringing science fiction movies to life.” However, there have been recent events that have marred DARPA’s often positive portrayal by media outlets, which paint the agency as a beacon of scientific “progress” that has “changed the world” for the better.For instance, in 2018, a group of European scientists accused the DARPA’s “Insect Allies” program of actually being a dystopian bioweapons program that would see insects introduce genetically modified viruses into plants to attack and devastate a targeted nation’s food supply. DARPA, of course, maintained that its intent to use these insects to genetically modify plants was instead about “protecting” the food supply. Regardless of DARPA’s assertions that it is merely a “defensive” program, it should be clear to readers that such a technology could easily be used either way, depending on the wielder.Though DARPA’s futuristic weapons of war often get the most attention from media, the agency has longstanding interests in tinkering with, not just the biology of plants, but of humans. DARPA, which is funded to the tune of approximately $3 billion a year, has various avenues through which it pursues these ambitions, with many of those now under the purview of the agency’s “Biological Technologies Office” (BTO), created in 2014. As of late, some of DARPA’s human biology and biotech projects at its BTO have been getting a massive PR boost thanks to the current coronavirus crisis, with recent reports even claiming that the agency “might have created the best hopes for stopping Covid-19.”Most of these technologies garnering positive media coverage thanks to Covid-19 were developed several years ago. They include the DARPA-funded platforms used to produce DNA and RNA vaccines, classes of vaccine that has never been approved for human use in the U.S. and involve injecting foreign genetic material into the human body. Notably, it is this very class of vaccine, now being produced by DARPA-partnered companies, that billionaire and global health “philanthropist” Bill Gates recently asserted has him “most excited” relative to other Covid-19 vaccine candidates. Yet, key aspects regarding these vaccines and other DARPA “healthcare” initiatives have been left out of these recent positive reports, likely because they provide a window into what is arguably the agency’s darkest agenda.In 2006, DARPA announced its Predicting Health and Disease (PHD) program, which sought to determine “whether an individual will develop an infectious disease prior to the onset of symptoms.” The PHD program planned to accomplish this by “identifying changes in the baseline state of human health through frequent surveillance” with a specific focus on “viral, upper respiratory pathogens.”
Three years later, in 2010, DARPA-funded researchers at Duke University created the foundation for this tool, which would use the genetic analysis of blood samples to determine if someone is infected with a virus before they show symptoms. Reports at the time claimed that these “preemptive diagnoses” would be transmitted to “a national, web-based influenza map” available via smartphone.Following the creation of DARPA’s BTO in 2014, this particular program gave rise to the “In Vivo Nanoplatforms (IVN)” program. The diagnostics branch of that program, abbreviated as IVN:Dx, “investigates technologies that incorporate implantable nanoplatforms composed of bio-compatible, nontoxic materials; in vivo sensing of small and large molecules of biological interest; multiplexed detection of analytes at clinically relevant concentrations; and external interrogation of the nanoplatforms without using implanted electronics for communication.” Past reports on the program describe it as developing “classes of nanoparticles to sense and treat illness, disease, and infection on the inside. The tech involves implantable nanoparticles which sense specific molecules of biological interest.”DARPA’s IVN program has since helped to finance and produce “soft, flexible hydrogels that are injected just beneath the skin to perform [health] monitoring and that sync to a smartphone app to give the use immediate health insights,” a product currently marketed and created by the DARPA-funded and National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded company Profusa. Profusa, which has received millions upon millions from DARPA in recent years, asserts that the information generated by their injectable biosensor would be “securely shared” and accessible to “individuals, physicians and public health practitioners.” However, the current push for a national “contact tracing” system based on citizens’ private health data is likely to expand that data sharing, conveniently fitting with DARPA’s years-old goal of creating a national, web-based database of preemptive diagnoses.Profusa is also backed by Google, which is intimately involved in these new mass surveillance “contact tracing” initiatives, and counts former Senate majority leader William Frist among its board members. They are also partnered with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)The company also has considerable overlap with the diagnostic company Cepheid, which recently won FDA approval for its rapid coronavirus test and was previously awarded lucrative government contracts to detect anthrax in the U.S. postal system. As of this past March, Profusa again won DARPA funding to determine if their injectable biosensors can predict future pandemics, including the now widely predicted “second wave” of Covid-19, and detect those infected up to three weeks before they would otherwise show symptoms. The company expects to have its biosensors FDA licensed for this purpose by early next year, about the same time a coronavirus vaccine is expected to be available to the general public.
“Living Foundries”. Another long-standing DARPA program, now overseen by BTO, is known as “Living Foundries.” According to DARPA’s website, Living Foundries “aims to enable adaptable, scalable, and on-demand production of [synthetic] molecules by programming the fundamental metabolic processes of biological systems to generate a vast number of complex molecules that are not otherwise accessible. Through Living Foundries, DARPA is transforming synthetic biomanufacturing into a predictable engineering practice supportive of a broad range of national security objectives.”The types of research this “Living Foundries” program supports involves the creation of “artificial life” including the creation of artificial genetic material, including artificial chromosomes, the creation of “entirely new organisms,” and using artificial genetic material to “add new capacities” to human beings (i.e. genetically modifying humans through the insertion of synthetically-created genetic material).The latter is of particular concern (though all are honestly concerning), as DARPA also has a project called “Advanced Tools for Mammalian Genome Engineering,” which – despite having “mammalian” in the name – is focused specifically on improving “the utility of Human Artificial Chromosomes (HACs),” which DARPA describes as a “fundamental tool in the development of advanced therapeutics, vaccines, and cellular diagnostics.” Though research papers often focus on HACs as a revolutionary medical advancement, they are also frequently promoted as a means of “enhancing” humans by imbuing them with non-natural characteristics, including halting aging or improving cognition.DARPA is known to be involved in research where these methods are used to create “super soldiers” that no longer require sleep or regular meals, among other augmented “features,” and has another program about creating “metabolically dominant” fighters. Reports on these programs also discuss the other, very disconcerting use of these same technologies, “genetic weapons” that would “subvert DNA” and “undermine people’s minds and bodies.”Another potential application being actively investigated by DARPA is its BioDesign program, which is examining the creation of synthetic organisms that are created to be immortal and programmed with a “kill switch” allowing a synthetic, yet organic organism to be “turned off” at any time. This has led some to speculate such research could open the doors to the creation of “human replicants” used for fighting wars and other tasks, such as those that appear in the science fiction film Bladerunner.However, these genetic “kill switches” could also be inserted into actual humans through artificial chromosomes, which – just as they have the potential to extend life – also have the potential to cut it short. Notably, it was revealed in 2017 that DARPA had invested $100 million in “gene drive” research, which is involves the use of genetic modification to wipe out entire populations, explaining why it it often referred to as a “genetic extinction” technology.In addition, other DARPA experiments involve the use of genetically modified viruses that insert genetic material into human cells, specifically neurons in the brain, in order to “tweak” human brain chemistry. In one example, DARPA-funded research has altered human brain cells to produce two new proteins, the first allowing neural activity to be easily detected by external devices and the second allowing “magnetic nanoparticles” to “induce an image or sound in the patient’s mind.”
“Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology”. Changing human brain chemistry and functionality at the cellular level is only one of numerous DARPA initiatives aimed at changing how human beings think and perceive reality. Since 2002, DARPA has acknowledged its efforts to create a “Brain-Machine Interface (BMI).” Though first aimed at creating “a wireless brain modem for a freely moving rat,” which would allow the animal’s movements to be remotely controlled, DARPA wasn’t shy about the eventual goal of applying such brain “enhancement” to humans in order to enable soldiers to “communicate by thought alone” or remotely control human beings (on the enemy side only, so they say) for the purposes of war.The project, which has advanced greatly in recent years, has long raised major concerns among prominent defense scientists, some of whom warned in a 2008 report that “remote guidance or control of a human being” could quickly backfire were an adversary to gain access to the implanted technology (opening up the possibility of “hacking” a person’s brain), and they also raised concerns about the general ethical perils of such technologies. Work began in 2011 on developing “brain implants” for use in human soldiers, officially with the goal of treating neurological damage in veterans, and such implants have been tested on human volunteers in DARPA-funded experiments since at least 2015.Concerns, like those raised by those defense scientists in 2008, have been regularly dismissed by DARPA, which has consistently claimed that its controversial research projects are tempered by their in-house “ethical experts.” However, it worth noting how DARPA’s leadership views these ethical conundrums, since they ultimately have the last word. For example, in 2015, Michael Goldblatt, then-director of DARPA’s Defense Sciences Office (DSO), which oversees most aspects of the agency’s “super soldier” program, told journalist Annie Jacobsen that he saw no difference between “having a chip in your brain that could help control your thoughts” and “a cochlear implant that helps the deaf hear.” When pressed about the unintended consequences of such technology, Goldblatt stated that “there are unintended consequences for everything.”Thus, it is worth pointing out that, while DARPA-developed technologies – from human genetic engineering to the brain-machine interfaces – are often first promoted as something that will revolutionize and improve human health, DARPA sees the use of these technologies for such ends as being on the same footing as other dystopian and frankly nightmarish applications, like thought control. BMIs are no exception, having first been promoted as a way to “boost bodily functions of veterans with neural damage or post-traumatic stress disorder” and to allow amputees to control advanced prosthetics. While these do indeed represent major medical advances, DARPA’s leadership has made it clear that they see no distinction between the medical use of BMIs and using them to exert near total control over a human being by “guiding” their thoughts and even their movements.Such stark admission from DARPA’s leadership makes it worth exploring the state of these current “brain-machine” interface programs as well as their explicit goals. For instance, one of the goals of DARPA’s Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology (N3) program involves using “noninvasive or minimally invasive brain-computer interfaces” to “read and write” directly onto the brain.According to one recent report on DARPA’s N3 program, one example of “minimally invasive” technologies would involve:",0
"In January, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced it would begin funding vaccine candidates for the coronavirus outbreak, long before it became a major global issue. CEPI describes itself as “a partnership of public, private, philanthropic and civil organizations that will finance and co-ordinate the development of vaccines against high priority public health threats” and was founded in 2017 by the governments of Norway and India along with the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. That month, CEPI only chose two pharmaceutical companies to receive funding for their efforts to develop a vaccine for Covid-19 – Moderna and Inovio Pharmaceuticals.As previously mentioned, these two companies are DARPA-backed firms that frequently tout their “strategic alliance” with DARPA in press releases and on their websites. DARPA has also provided these companies with significant amounts of funding. For instance, the top funders behind Inovio Pharmaceuticals include both DARPA and the Pentagon’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the company has received millions in dollars in grants from DARPA, including a $45 million grant to develop a vaccine for Ebola. They were also recently awarded over $8 million from the U.S. military to develop a small, portable intradermal device for delivering DNA vaccines, which was jointly developed by Inovio and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), which also manages the “biodefense” lab at Fort Detrick.In addition, the German company CureVac, which is also developing a CEPI-backed RNA vaccine for Covid-19, is another long-time recipient of DARPA funding. They were one of DARPA’s earliest investments in the technology, winning a $33.1 million DARPA contract to develop their “RNActive” vaccine platform in 2011.
In Moderna’s case, DARPA financed the production and development of their RNA vaccine production platform and their RNA therapy candidate for Chikungunya virus (their first for an infectious disease) was developed in direct collaboration with the agency. Since 2016, Moderna’s RNA vaccine program has received $100 million in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation has since poured millions directly into both Moderna’s and Inovio’s Covid-19 vaccine efforts.Gates’ backing of DNA and RNA vaccines is significant, given that Gates – a billionaire with unparalleled influence and control over global healthcare policy – recently asserted that the best options for a Covid-19 vaccine are these same vaccines, despite the fact that they have never before been approved for use in humans. Yet, thanks to the emergency authorizations activated due to the current crisis, both Moderna’s and Inovio’s testing for these vaccines has skipped animal trials and gone straight to human testing. They are also set to be fast-tracked for widespread use in a matter of months. Moderna’s clinical trial in humans began in mid-March, followed by Inovio’s in the beginning of April. Thus, they are not only Gates’ favorites to be the new vaccine, but are also slated to be the first to complete clinical trials and garner emergency U.S. government approval, especially Moderna’s vaccine which is being jointly developed with the government’s NIH.The rapid rise to prominence of Moderna’s and Inovio’s Covid-19 vaccines has resulted in several media articles praising DARPA as having provided our “best hope” for thwarting the coronavirus crisis. In addition to its backing of Moderna’s and Inovio’s own efforts, DARPA itself, specifically DARPA’s BTO, is set to have a “temporary” vaccine for Covid-19 available in a matter of weeks that will involve the production of synthetic antibodies that would ostensibly provide immunity for a few months until a longer-lasting vaccine (such as those produced by Moderna and Inovio) is available.DARPA’s antibody treatment for Covid-19 is pursuing two routes, including the “human body as bio-reactor” approach that would involve synthetic DNA or RNA being injected in order to prompt the body to produce the necessary antibodies. Defense One notes that DARPA’s Covid-19 treatment would utilize techniques that had resulted from the agency’s investments in microfluidics (the manipulation of liquids at the sub-millimeter range), nanotechnology fabrication and “new approaches to gene sequencing.”Persistent Concerns. While most media reports have painted these DARPA-led efforts as entirely positive, it is worth noting that concerns have been raised, though these concerns have hardly gotten the coverage they warrant. For instance, Nature recently noted some key points regarding safety issues related to the race for a Covid-19 vaccine, including the fact that all “previous coronavirus vaccines have not all proven appropriate or even safe,” with some past attempts at coronavirus vaccines having resulted in antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE results in cells more rapidly taking up the virus and speeding up the virus’ replication, increasing its infectiousness and virulence.Nature also noted that the two coronavirus vaccines for SARS that managed to pass phase 1 trials ended up, in subsequent studies, causing immune hypersensitivity in mice “resulting in severe immunopathology,” i.e. permanent defects or malfunctions in the immune system. In addition, Nature also pointed out that it is unknown how strong an immune response is needed to confer immunity for Covid-19 and coronaviruses in general, making it incredibly difficult to gauge if a vaccine is even effective.Another issue worth noting involves concerns raised about Inovio Pharmaceuticals by investment research firm Citron Research, which compared Inovio to Theranos, the disgraced medical technology company that had initially promised to offer diagnoses for numerous diseases via a simple blood test, but was later revealed to be a sham. Citron asserted that “It’s been over 40 years since Inovio was founded, yet the company has NEVER [sic] brought a product to market, and all the while insiders have enriched themselves with hefty salaries and large stock sales.”Citron Research went on to say that the company’s claim to have designed their Covid-19 vaccine in only 3 hours based on a computer algorithm was hard to believe, stating that “Inovio has a ‘computer algorithm’ that no one else in the world has and is arguably one of the greatest breakthroughs in vaccine discovery in the past 100 years, and yet this ‘computer algorithm’ is not mentioned once in any of its 10-K’s or 10-Q’s? Sounds like Theranos to us.” It also noted that Inovio’s partnerships with pharmaceutical companies Roche and AstraZeneca ended up failing with those two companies canceling the partnership despite claims from Inovio’s CEO that whey would “continue to thrive.”A Not-So-Hidden Agenda.Of course, these are just concerns focused on corporate behavior and obstacles towards making a Covid-19 vaccine in general. As this report has already shown in detail, DARPA’s other experiments with the same technologies (particularly genetic engineering, synthetic chromosomes, and nanotechnology) that are being used to produce RNA and DNA vaccines for Covid-19 are arguably more concerning. This is especially true given that DARPA-backed companies that describe themselves as “strategic partners” of the agency are those manufacturing these vaccines. In addition, thanks to backing from the U.S. government and Bill Gate, among others, they are are also slated to be among the first vaccines (if not the first) approved for widespread use.It is certainly troubling that media coverage of DARPA’s efforts and the efforts of Moderna and Inovio have thus far not included critical reporting regarding the different branches of DARPA’s research that has produced the technology involved in creating these vaccines, leaving little room for public scrutiny of their safety, efficacy and their potential for unintended effects on human genetics.This is particularly alarming given that, over the past several weeks, efforts have been taking shape in many countries to enforce mandatory vaccinations once a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available. In some countries, it appears likely that the Covid-19 vaccine will not be made mandatory per say, but will be required for those who wish to return to any semblance of “normalcy” in terms of public gatherings, working certain jobs, leaving one’s home for longer periods of time and so on.Would those involved in creating such a mandatory vaccine, e.g. DARPA, pass up the opportunity to utilize the same technologies involved in producing the vaccine for some of their other admitted goals? This question, of course, has no obvious answer, but the fact that the arc of DARPA’s research is aimed at the weaponization of human biology and genetics in a way that is ripe for misuse, suggests very worrying possibilities that warrant scrutiny. Indeed, if one merely looks at how the crisis has been a boon for the Orwellian plans of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) and the federal government’s current efforts to dramatically increase its powers amid the current crisis, it becomes increasingly difficult to give government agencies like DARPA and their corporate partners like Moderna and Inovio the benefit of the doubt.This is especially true given that – without a major crisis such as that currently dominating world events – people would likely be unreceptive to the widespread introduction of many of the technologies DARPA has been developing, whether their push to create cyborg “super soldiers” or injectable BMIs with the capability to control one’s thoughts. Yet, amid the current crisis, many of these same technologies are being sold to the public as “healthcare,” a tactic DARPA often uses. As the panic and fear regarding the virus continues to build and as people become increasingly desperate to return to any semblance of normalcy, millions will willingly take a vaccine, regardless of any government-mandated vaccination program. Those who are fearful and desperate will not care that the vaccine may include nanotechnology or have the potential to genetically modify and re-program their very being, as they will only want the current crisis that has upended the world to stop.In this context, the current coronavirus crisis appears to be the perfect storm that will allow DARPA’s dystopian vision to take hold and burst forth from the darkest recesses of the Pentagon into full public view. However, DARPA’s transhumanist vision for the military and for humanity presents an unprecedented threat, not just to human freedom, but an existential threat to human existence and the building blocks of biology itself.Question Everything, Come To Your Own Conclusions.",0

"In this explosive interview, Spiro Skouras is joined by Dr. Sherri Tenpenny. The two discuss the latest developments regarding the coronavirus situation which was declared a global health pandemic by the Gates-funded World Health Organization, as more information comes to light questioning the need for a global lockdown.
Dr. Tenpenny and Spiro examine and explore the motives of the global response by governments, global institutions and private interests, as Dr. Tenpenny exposes perhaps the most alarming aspect of the crisis yet!No, it is not the virus, it is the blank check issued to the vaccine and drug manufacturers, which not only provides unlimited funding, but also provides blanket immunity to Big Pharma for any harm attributed with the treatments produced during the declared emergency, including all drugs and vaccines.This blanket immunity is provided by the US government under the PREP Act and provides the drug and vaccine manufacturers the ‘Ultimate Blank Check’ during a declared emergency. As Dr. Tenpenny points out, the vaccine and drug manufacturers have zero incentive to produce a safe product, as the declared emergency not only rolls back regulatory standards and removes them from any and all liability, but it also ensures the government will purchase their products.This is an unprecedented level of immunity which raises many questions and safety concerns.",0
"Until recently, the concept of mandatory and mass vaccination has been only a worrisome possibility. Vaccination laws are passed and monitored at the state level, not at the federal level. But while the country was still struggling to recover from the events of September 11, 2001, and the bioterrorism scares of smallpox and anthrax threats, the groundwork to make vaccines mandatory began to change in 2003, during President George W. Bush’s State of the Union Address. On that fateful night, Bush revealed the creation of Project BioShield, a comprehensive effort to develop and make available modern, effective drugs and vaccines to protect against attack by biological and chemical weapons.Project BioShield.Project BioShield set forth three major components:Creation of a permanent indefinite funding authority to spur development of medical countermeasures enabling the government to purchase vaccines and other therapies as soon as experts believe that they can be made safe and effective. Conferred new authority to the NIH to speed research and development of drugs and vaccines that would counter bioterrorism threats and,
Authorized emergency “fast track provisions for the release of treatments—drugs and vaccines—still waiting for approval by the FDA ‘in the event of an emergency.”As sweeping as those plans may seem, the legislation failed to include key provisions sought by the drug companies. Mosty importantly, complete liability protection for all of their bioterrorism products.During 2003 and 2004, any bills that were introduced by both the House and the Senate attempting to secure complete liability protection for the industry were done through federal law. In 2005 alone, 13 bills were introduced. One such bill, The Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005, was gaining traction. 1873. Introduced as S. 1873 by Senators Bill Frist (R-TN) and Richard Burr (R-NC), its purpose, according to Burr’s news release, was to “create a partnership between the government and private corporations by rapidly developing effective medical drugs and vaccines to protect the United States from deliberate, accidental, and natural incidents involving biological pathogens.”Nicknamed BioShield II, the bill planned to give unprecedented advantages to the industry and remove or severely weaken all of the safeguards that prevented dangerous vaccines, drugs, and medical devices from reaching consumers. S. 1873 was accelerated through the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, without hearings.Public outrage began almost immediately. Websites, news outlets, and nationwide radio hosts were exposing the unbelievable benefits the bill would convey to the drug companies. Dozens of activist groups representing many thousands of constituents rallied a campaign to notify Congress of their dissatisfaction with S.1873. Faxes, emails, and phone calls show message after message opposing the carte blanche promises drugmakers set out to receive. Because the outcry against S.1873 was so strong, the possibility of its passage was bleak.To circumvent this outrage, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist forced the attachment of a shortened version int HR 2863, the 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, literally at the eleventh hour. Called Division E—Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, Frist’s addendum added 40 pages to an existing 423-page bill on December 17, 2005 at 11:20 pm, well after the House Appropriation Committee members had signed off, and most had gone home. Soon referred to as the PREP Act, it gave sweeping and unprecedented immunity for drug companies for emergency products.The PREP ACT.The PREP Act provides complete immunity from liability for any loss relating to or resulting from, any product used to prevent or treat illness during a public health emergency. The immunity applies to entities and individuals involved in the development, manufacture, testing, distribution, administration, and use of medical countermeasures described in a Declaration. The only statutory exception to this immunity is for actions or failures to act that constitute “willful misconduct.” And as we will see, even willful misconduct may not be punished. For a full explanation of the scope of the Act, go here.Representative Dave Obey (D-WI), Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee made the following statement on the floor of the House on December 22, 2005:After the [Committee] finished at 6 p.m., Senator Frist (R-TN) marched over to the House side of the Capitol. He insisted 40 pages of legislation that had never been seen by Conferees be attached to the bill.Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) joined Frist’s insistence and without a vote of the Conferees, the legislation was unilaterally and arrogantly inserted into the bill. [This was] a blatantly abusive power-play by two of the most powerful men in Congress.Sweeping Provisions Against Americans
Passed in, Senator Frist (a medical doctor) handed the drug companies (a special interest group) more immunity than any bill that has ever been passed by Congress. The legislation provides at least four sweeping provisions: Immunity from all liability for all drugs, vaccines or biological products deemed as a “covered countermeasure.”Immunity from all accountability, no matter what a drug company did wrong. Even if the company’s dirty facility created a batch of contaminated vaccines that resulted in deaths or injuries to thousands of people, the drug company will remain immune from liability.Immunity from all liability for any product used for any public health emergency declared by the Secretary of HHS.
Immunity from all lawsuits. A person who suffers any type of loss will be legally prohibited from suing the drug companies; they now have immunity from almost everything, perhaps even murder.In simple terms, if a claim is filed by a plaintiff it can only go forward if the injured party can prove that the company performed an act of willful misconduct. In other words, the injured party would have to prove the vaccine maker created a product that intentionally caused them harm.Unbelievably, even then the drug company is still immune from accountability. Even if a pharmaceutical company knowingly harms people, the company will be immune from legal prosecution unless the U.S. Attorney General initiates enforcement action against the drug company in the name of the claimant. This means the U.S. government would have to go to bat for the plaintiff against the drug company for the lawsuit to move forward.Fast Forward: COVID19.Wasting no time, the Secretary of HHS, Alex Azar and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Robert P. Kadlec, MD, MTM&H, MS, issued Notice of Declaration of National Emergency and published in the Federal Register on March 17, 2020 (Vol. 85, No. 52). The Declaration was effective as of February 4, 2020. By declaring a national emergency for the SARS-CoV-19 virus and COVID-19, the Secretary evoked the PREP Act “to provide liability immunity for activities related to medical countermeasures against COVID–19.”Once this new, experimental COVID-19 vaccine is deemed to be a “covered countermeasure” there will be no going back. How can an experimental vaccine exist to protect from a virus that little is known about? Can you think of a worse-case outcome for many? The mainstream media is conditioning people to anticipate and even beg for this vaccine. It’s all part of the Plan.The Time for Mass Vaccination in Adults Has Arrived.The National Vaccine Plan (NVP) for adults was released in February 2010. It lays out the strategy to vaccinate all adults with all approved vaccines and “any vaccine that is approved, now and in the future.”The plan established four key goals. Each goal has objectives and strategies to guide implementation through 2020:Goal 1: Strengthen the adult immunization infrastructure. Goal 2: Improve access to adult vaccines.Goal 3: Increase community demand for adult immunizations. Goal 4: Foster innovation in adult vaccine development and vaccination-related technologies
Let’s look at a little closer at what the Plan has to say about Goal #3:Educate and encourage individuals and healthcare professionals to promote adult vaccination programs.Leverage group influence (faith-based groups, etc.) to promote and demand access to adult vaccinations.Create more robust EHRs to include standing orders, reminder calls, and reminder mailings.Encourage the development of “adult immunization champions” in communities and across all sectors.All forms of media and communication continually remind the general public that a “vaccine for the virus that causes COVID-19 is on the way” and “it’s coming soon.” The implied message is to anticipate it, wait for it and then, as soon as it arrives, go get your vaccine. The listener’s subconscious is being prepared to demand to be vaccinated.What Can You Do To Stop Mass Vaccination.I view most current events through the lens of history. As I wrote in Part 1 of this series, we’re seeing a repeat of what happened after 911. Only a few weeks after the towers came down in NYC, the draconian Patriot Act was passed into law on October 26, 2011. Now, within a few weeks of the outbreak of a coronavirus, a virus we don’t know much about or how long it will cause serious illness, the world has implemented draconian, stay-home “social distancing” rules. Even this phrase has psychological implications. They didn’t call it “physical distancing” but “social distancing,” a way to separate us at a time we should all be coming together.How serious is the risk from this pathogen? On the one hand, we hear that 80% of patients experience a mild form of the illness, which can include a fever and pneumonia, and many of these cases require little to no medical intervention. On the other, we hear that 200,000 to 2 million may die in the U.S. alone. Which is it? Are we really so afraid of this pathogen that we’ve shut down the world? Are we so afraid of contracting this infection that we’re anticipating—even looking forward to—the development of a vaccine that will be deemed a covered countermeasure and have no liability, even if it injures or kills many and protects no one?Non-Infectious Caused Deaths.Look at this chart closely (click here to enlarge).This is a graphic, from 2016, distributes the number of deaths by health risk factors throughout the entire world. It shows what people die from WITHOUT an infection by a rogue virus.The bottom line is most die from poor nutrition and conditions marked by high inflammation.Is it any wonder that these people have the highest risk of serious illness IF they become infected?Perhaps during this forced global shut own one of the most important things you can do is use the time to evaluate all the areas of your life: your physical health, your mental health and your spiritual health and relationship with God. Clean out some closets and finish a few projects you always wished you had time to do. Read—or write —the book that has been calling you forever. Eat better. Exercise more. Lose some weight. Catch up on your sleep. Play with your kids. Reconnect with your significant other.Perhaps God has put the entire world into Full Stop so we can meditate and reflect, taking time to course-correct toward what is really most important. Whenever I find myself feeling anxious about the future and the uncertainties of what is going on, I focus on this verse from the Bible: Psalms 46:10 – “Be still and know I am God.” If you can connect with that idea, you’ll be much more optimistic, and much less anxious, about the future.",0

"The uneven spread of the novel coronavirus around the world was clustered in several hot pockets while leaving other areas with scant outbreaks. This pattern developed in China, with the epicenter of Wuhan City in Hubei province owning, at one time, more than 99% of the cases and deaths over the rest of the country of 1.4 billion people.Outside the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong have not experienced the runaway infections or deaths that China did, with the latter twice experiencing the restart of last year’s protests. Although the coronavirus spread fast in South Korea and Japan in the beginning, both outbreaks were extinguished.In South Korea, the vectors for two of the country’s four clusters came from a Wuhan branch of a cult church and a Catholic church pilgrimage returning from Israel. Since then, South Korea has moved aggressively to defuse new clusters by radically testing people and disinfecting mass transit systems daily. With more than 9,100 cases and 126 deaths, and with one-third recovered, Korea has fewer cases and deaths than New York City. Today, South Korea also boasts the fewest number of new coronavirus cases, according to the BBC.Japan took a different route with the novel virus. Japan has only 1,200 cases and 130 deaths. A total of 712 infections came from one supercluster in the Diamond Princess cruise ship, docked in Yokohama. That’s more than half of the entire country.The International Olympic Committee recently canceled the Tokyo Summer Olympics. The cancellation isn’t due to the outbreak in Japan, but likely from so many nations battling the virus.The New Epicenter of Northern Italy.In March, the COVID-19 outbreak shifted from China to Northern Italy. Soon after, the entire nation of 60 million was placed under strict quarantine. Social distancing turned into permission slips to leave one’s home. Despite the containment efforts, the virus hit Italy very hard. It emptied streets, stopped life as Italians knew it while killing more than 7,500 people out of 75,000 total infected.On the first weekend of spring, images emerged from Italy, showing similar scenes of horror. Scenes that were eerily reminiscent of Wuhan: people walking down the street, collapsing dead without any external force. Dozens of such videos and photos showed the fallen people spread eagle, flat on their backs, face down on sidewalks. Lifeless. No blood splatter. Outside of one similar case in New York City, no other place in the world has produced such anomalies.Why?What causes people, who appear to be fit, to keel over without a seizure or to tremble suddenly? What is the underlying cause? And what makes Wuhan and Northern Italy different than other parts of the world? So different that COVID-19 kills people with no apparent explanation?Why Wuhan?In 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology selected Wuhan as a pilot city for the “Made in China 2025” plan. The overarching goal aimed at the industrial city of 11 million to become the world’s Internet of Things mecca. The goal? A 5G smart city that would connect homes, offices, hospitals, factories, and autonomous vehicles via a digital fabric.Renowned for its factories and severe pollution, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) envisioned elevating Wuhan as the global smart city of the future. All of the commands, controls, data sharing, and data flowing through artificial intelligence systems would showcase China as the preeminent digital leader of the world.
At the center of the plan, the Chinese telecom syndicate of ZTE, Huawei, Hubei Mobile, and China Unicom began to transform Wuhan into a giant 5G “hot spot” for wireless technology. The 5G launch in the Hubei capital city culminated with the October 2019 Military World Games. Wuhan activated 20% of its 10,000 5G base stations, and the rest by the end of the year. With the hottest 5G pilot city on the planet, the CCP planned to leverage the publicity to attract more foreign investment and lure international businesses to prop up China’s flagging economy.Then disaster struck.A New Pneumonia.In mid-December, just six weeks after the military games concluded, the first cases of a new pneumonia started to show up in area hospitals. Over 72 hours through New Year’s day, scientists decoded the novel virus. On January 2, Wuhan notified the CCP and the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) about the outbreak. The two governing bodies of the Peoples Republic of China took precautions for their leaders, personnel, and buildings. Instead of telling the world about the outbreak, the regime kept it under tight control. Three weeks after sequencing the virus, Xi Jinping finally made his first public comment about the discovery of COVID-19 and the epidemic ravaging Wuhan.By then, the epidemic erupted out of control. Millions became infected, and tens of thousands in Hubei died. These numbers far exceeded the “official” numbers claimed by the CCP and supported by the World Health Organization (WHO).At its height, many leaked videos showed people falling, collapsing, or sprawled dead in the streets of Wuhan. Nowhere else in the infected areas of China did similar scenes show that type of death.Then a clinical study comparing “Imported cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province,” by Jian Wu, et al., discovered a key finding between Wuhan and Jiangsu patients.
“Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan.”So, what was the underlying cofactor that separated Wuhan from all other areas in China? And what was the factor that was making the virus more virulent?Body Bags.While the WHO praised China’s response to the outbreak, only in Wuhan did the police weld infected people in their apartments to die. Only in Wuhan did they burn bodies beyond the capacity of the crematoriums. Only in Wuhan did the regime receive accusations of burying the dead in body bags under cover of the night.In looking for a cofactor, several outlets suggest Wuhan’s acute pollution was to blame for the virus’ death toll. Others theorized that a vaccine trial “primed” a subset of citizens, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19. In the former, there are many other cities in Asia as polluted that didn’t experience the same corona clusters. While in the latter, no new vaccine trials were launched in Wuhan in 2019.5G Microwave Effects at 60GHz.In 2001, Shigeaki Hakusui, then president of Harmonix Corporation, explained why fifth-generation wireless technology was needed to reach the goal of creating smart cities. He said it would require bandwidth and efficiency to meet the data demand as the Internet moved toward mobile technology. That was two decades ago.Hakusui noted that 60GHz was the true radiofrequency that would allow for reliable transmission of data, due to its “98 percent oxygen absorption” rate. This allows the invisible signals to travel from point A and B, and back again on the same path. Super-efficient and a technological milestone.Hakusui writes:Since the presence of O2 is fairly consistent at ground level, its effect on 60GHz radio propagation is easily modeled for margin budgeting purposes. Also, the high level of attenuation from oxygen absorption makes even the worst weather-related attenuation insignificant, especially on the short paths where 60GHz systems operate.He stated, unequivocally, that 60GHz would deliver the last mile efficiently, as the “oxygen absorption makes possible the same-frequency reuse within a very localized region of air space.”The downside to 5G, however, is the lack of biological safety and health tests to support its global rollout. Even workers who installed 5G towers are burning them down. Does the electrification of the entire planet make sense? Do thousands of satellites being deployed where infrastructure doesn’t exist, such as the oceans make sense?Unsettling Results.Testing 5G by trial and error has already produced some unsettling results. They include the mass deaths of birds in the Netherlands, the cutting down of half of Sheffield, England’s trees, and strange illness clusters of children in some U.S. schools.Most people don’t grasp or care that their WiFi can send signals through drywall, glass, and concrete slabs, just the same as beams go through the human body. And with 5G a far more focused beam, those signals have no trouble traveling through a person.The problem is for every breath we breathe, our blood transports oxygen throughout the core, extremities, to the vital organs, heart, and brain.If 5G at 60 GHz frequency zips through the air, absorbing most of the oxygen, disrupting the electrons that bind 02 molecules that, combined with a hydrogen atom, form water vapor, what is that frequency doing to blood cells, which consist primarily of water and carry the oxygen?Do the disruption of the body’s biorhythm, breathing, and oxygen distribution begin to explain what happens to the people who dropped dead?Mt. Everest “Death Zone”.Studies of acute mountain sickness show that as climbers ascend in altitude, they hit an endurance wall from a lack of oxygen. “At 4500 m [14,764 feet], the real amount of oxygen in the air composition is only 12% diluted, which is approximately 60% of sea-level oxygen,” according to Brazilian scientists, who published a paper last year.Higher up the mountain in the “death zone” of Mt. Everest, climbers die due to severe hyperbaric hypoxia, even with bottled oxygen as their blood coagulates. In another view, altitude sickness starves the brain of oxygen.That does stack up and explains the unusual scenes of Wuhan citizens dying literally in the streets. They keel over dead, not shaking from a heart attack or seizure, never resuscitated.Milan in Northern Italy is the 5G capital of Europe. Iran, where suspected millions have been infected, has installed 5G deployments. And sure enough, the three Princess line cruise ships—Diamond, Grand, and now Ruby—had GEO and MEO satellites beaming 5G down to the ships as they travel via a Medallion Net receiver system last autumn.Although South Korea is a wirelessly connected nation, it doesn’t have the number of cases like other places in the world that does. Yet, its third and fourth coronavirus clusters were in 5G-hot gymnasium and hospital.As the anomalous deaths of people in Wuhan and Italy can attest, society, the telecom industry, and government are long past due to study the health effects of 5G, especially at the “unlicensed” 60GHz frequency.",0

"You are about to swallow a giant red pill, my friend — but, first, I want to express my sincere condolences to anyone who has been negatively affected by the situation, whether through illness, financial hardships, loss of life, or loss of your former lifestyle. I also released a full episode all about my thoughts and a spiritual perspective on this hardship last week, so go back and check out episode 270. (It ends on a positive note, I promise!).This week, however, we’re digging into the possible connection between the coronavirus and 5G. This is a question that was first brought to my attention by Dr. Thomas Cowan in a couple of YouTube videos, which may or may not still be viewable thanks to the rampant big tech censorship going on right now. Then, if you try using that ubiquitous search engine to learn more, you’ll see results from the MSM going out of their way to discredit Dr. Cowan and mischaracterizing what he said.But why are they working so hard to silence this point of view? Who gains from trying to squash anyone who’s just asking questions, and what’s wrong with asking these questions in the first place? If this hypothesis is just flat out wrong and doesn’t include any medical advice at all, why does it need to be removed from every corner of YouTube and censored?So, as these questions were swirling around my head, I just had to go straight to the source and Dr. Cowan on a call.I’ve actually been a fan of Dr. Cowan and the powders he makes at Dr. Cowan’s Garden for a long time now, and I’ve been looking for a good reason to bring him onto the show — and I don’t think we’re going to get a better reason than this any time soon.",0

"On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) China office heard the first reports of a previously-unknown virus behind a number of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in Eastern China with a population of over 11 million.What started as an epidemic mainly limited to China has now become a truly global pandemic. There have now been over 3,766,394 confirmed cases and 263,983 deaths, according the John Hopkins University Covid-19 dashboard, which collates information from national and international health authorities. The disease has been detected in more than 200 countries and territories, with Italy, the US and Spain experiencing the most widespread outbreaks outside of China. In the UK, there have been 201,101 confirmed cases and 30,076 deaths as of May 5. The true number of infections and deaths is likely to be considerably higher.
The Chinese government responded to the initial outbreak by placing Wuhan and nearby cities under a de-facto quarantine encompassing roughly 50 million people in Hubei province. This quarantine is now slowly being lifted, as authorities watch to see whether cases will rise again. The US is now the new epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak. As of May 7, the country has 1,228,609 confirmed infections and 73m431 deaths. In Italy, where the death toll surpassed that of China on March 19, the government took the unprecedented step of extending a lockdown to the entire country, shutting cinemas, theatres, gyms, discos and pubs and banning funerals and weddings. In the UK, the government has shut schools, pubs, restaurants, bars, cafés and all non-essential shops for at least six weeks.
On March 23, prime minister Boris Johnson put the UK under lockdown saying that police will now have the power to fine people who gather in groups of more than two or who are outside for non-essential reasons. People with the main coronavirus symptoms – a fever or dry cough – are required to stay at home for seven days while households in which at least one person is displaying symptoms should quarantine themselves for 14 days. Four days later the prime minister and health secretary Matt Hancock both tested positive for the virus – Johnson spent three nights in intensive care and then stayed at the prime minister's country residence, Chequers to recover. He returned to work at Downing Street on the morning of April 27.On March 11 the WHO officially declared the Covid-19 outbreak a pandemic. ""WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction,"" said its director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Although the WHO designated Covid-19 a ""public health emergency of international concern"" (PHEIC) on January 30, it had been reluctant to call it a pandemic. ""Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death,"" Adhanom said.A quick note on naming. Although popularly referred to as coronavirus, on February 11, the WHO announced the official name of the disease: Covid-19. The virus that causes that disease is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2 for short.",1
"The disease appears to have originated from a Wuhan seafood market where wild animals, including marmots, birds, rabbits, bats and snakes, are traded illegally. Coronaviruses are known to jump from animals to humans, so it’s thought that the first people infected with the disease – a group primarily made up of stallholders from the seafood market – contracted it from contact with animals.The hunt for the animal source of Covid-19 is still unknown, although there are some strong contenders. A team of virologists at the Wuhan Institute for Virology released a detailed paper showing that the new coronaviruses' genetic makeup is 96 per cent identical to that of a coronavirus found in bats, while a study published on March 26 argues that genetic sequences of coronavirus in pangolins are between 88.5 and 92.4 per cent similar to the human virus. Some early cases of Covid-19, however, appear to have inflicted people with no link to the Wuhan market at all, suggesting that the initial route of human infection may pre-date the market cases.The Wuhan market was shut down for inspection and cleaning on January 1, but by then it appears that Covid-19 was already starting to spread beyond the market itself. On January 21, the WHO Western Pacific office said the disease was also being transmitted between humans – evidence of which is apparent after medical staff became infected with the virus.",1
"Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are known to infect both humans and animals, and in humans cause respiratory illness that range from common colds to much more serious infections. The most well-known case of a coronavirus epidemic was Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), which, after first being detected in southern China in 2002, went on to affect 26 countries and resulted in more than 8,000 cases and 774 deaths.While the cause of the current outbreak was initially unknown, on January 7 Chinese health authorities identified that it was caused by to a strain of coronavirus that hadn’t been encountered in humans before. Five days later the Chinese government shared the genetic sequence of the virus so that other countries could develop their own diagnostic kits. That virus is now called Sars-CoV-2.Although symptoms of coronaviruses are often mild – the most common symptoms are a fever and dry cough – in some cases they lead to more serious respiratory tract illness including pneumonia and bronchitis. These can be particularly dangerous in older patients, or people who have existing health conditions, and this appears to be the case with Covid-19. A study of 44,415 early Chinese Covid-19 patients found that 81 per cent of people with confirmed infections experienced only mild symptoms. Of the remaining cases, 14 per cent were in a severe condition while five per cent of people were critical cases, suffering from respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure. In the Chinese study, 2.3 per cent of all confirmed cases died, although the actual death rate is probably much lower as many more people will have been infected with the virus than tested positive.",1
"China felt the initial brunt of the Covid-19 epidemic. At the peak of its outbreak in mid-February, the country saw more than 5,000 cases in a single day. As of May 7, Chinese health authorities had acknowledged over 83,970 cases and 4,637 deaths – most of them within the province of Hubei. Since March, however, the country has seen a remarkable slowdown. on March 17, China recorded just 39 new cases of the virus. Most of the country's new cases are imported from elsewhere in the world – for now at least, it appears that China has its outbreak under control.But while things were slowing down in China, the outbreak started picking up in the rest of the world. There are now confirmed cases in at least 200 countries and territories. Outside of China, the US has seen the highest number of cases. The country – which has been criticised for its slow rollout of testing and confused approach to the crisis – now has 1,228,609 confirmed infections and 73,431 deaths.Italy has seen the highest number of deaths in Europe, with 29,684 deaths and 214,457 confirmed infections, mostly in the north of the country. The country has had the longest-running lockdown of any country and on May 4 started to ease its restrictions for the first time after nine weeks.Spain is also in the grip of a significant outbreak. The country has 220,325 confirmed infections and 25,857 deaths – the third-highest number within Europe after the UK and Italy. There, citizens are under lockdown, with the government shutting all schools, bars, restaurants and non-essential supermarkets down. People are only allowed to leave their homes to buy food or to go to work. Germany has 168,162 confirmed cases and 7,275 deaths, a rate lower than many other European countries. Social distancing rules stayed in place until May 4, but the country is slowly relaxing its requirements with some shops starting to re-open their doors. Austria, which has 15,752 confirmed cases and 609 deaths was the first European country to partially lift its lockdown on April 14.While the number of new cases continues to rise sharply, people are also recovering from the infection. Globally, 1,248,874 people have recovered from Covid-19 – about 33 per cent of all of the people who had confirmed infections, although the true number of coronavirus cases will be much higher.",1
"Covid-19 shares many of its symptoms with the flu or common cold, although there are certain symptoms common to flu and colds that are not usually seen in Covid-19. People with confirmed cases of Covid-19 rarely suffer from a runny nose, for instance.The most common Covid-19 symptoms are a fever and a dry cough. Of 55,924 early Chinese cases of the disease, nearly 90 per cent of patients experienced a fever and just over two-thirds suffered with a dry cough. That’s why the UK government is advising anyone with a high temperature or a new, continuous cough to stay at home for seven days or, if they live with other people, for the entire household to isolate for 14 days from the first onset of symptoms.Other Covid-19 symptoms are less common. Just under 40 per cent of people with the disease experience fatigue, while a third of people cough up sputum – a thick mucus from within the lungs. Other rarer symptoms include shortness of breath, muscle pain, sore throats, headaches or chills, loss of smell or taste. According to the WHO, symptoms tend to appear between five and six days after infection.",1
"A vaccine for Covid-19 isn’t around the corner. Bringing vaccines to the market is a notoriously slow process and any potential vaccine will have to pass multiple stages of testing for safety and effectiveness. And once we know a vaccine is safe, we will also need to manufacture it at a scale high enough to use across the world. It’s likely that any vaccine is around 18 months away.That said, there is lots of work being done to develop a vaccine for Covid-19. The pharmaceutical firm Sanofi is trying to build on its already-approved flu vaccine and turn it into something suitable to treat Covid-19. Other approaches – such as one being trialled by the University of Oxford – are focusing on the external spike proteins on the Covid-19 virus as a way to target vaccines.But accelerating these efforts will require funding. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has called for $2 billion in funding to support the development of new coronavirus vaccines.",1
"As the number of daily infections and deaths has plateaued in many places, European countries are taking tentative steps to ease their lockdown measures with varying approaches.Italy's daily coronavirus death toll is at its lowest since March 14 and prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced that from May 4, citizens will be allowed to visit their relatives in small numbers. Factories and construction sites will be allowed to reopen, but schools will remain closed until September. In Spain which after Italy has seen more deaths than any other European country, parents are now allowed to take their children outside once per day and, if the toll continues to slow, all citizens will be allowed to exercise and walk outdoors from May 2. The UK will remain on lockdown until at least May 7, however, prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce plans to ease measures before then as he returns to Downing Street on April 27 after recovering from coronavirus.In order to prevent a deadly second wave of infections, the UK and its European neighbours are ramping up testing in the wider community. The UK Department of Health and Social Care will contact 20,000 households in England and invite them to take part in an initial study to track coronavirus transmission. All participants will receive a nose and throat swab to test for whether or not they currently have the virus and adults in some 1,000 of the households will provide monthly blood samples to find out what proportion of the population has developed antibodies to Covid-19. The study is set to be extended to 300,000 people over the next 12 months.Work on contact tracing apps is also underway in the UK. But unlike in countries like South Korea and China, which use a combination of CCTV, credit card data and geolocation information, the UK's app will rely on the short-range wireless technology Bluetooth to trace people's location. The idea is that when a person has crossed paths with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, the app can be instantly alert them and let them request a test.",1
"Remember last year when Washington Post reporters were boldly declaring that vitamins C and D could not (and should not) be used against respiratory infections? The information I was sharing about their use was deemed so dangerous to public health that I was branded as a ""fake news"" site by self-appointed, pharma-owned arbiters of truth like NewsGuard.How times have changed. After having defamatory lies published about me, vitamins C and D are now (finally) being adopted in the conventional treatment of novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. That just goes to show that when push comes to shove, the truth eventually prevails. When the medicine cabinet is empty, and doctors have limited options, suddenly the basics become viable again, and that is good news indeed, as it's likely to save thousands of lives, while keeping health care costs down.
Vitamin C Treatment Implemented for Coronavirus Infection.As reported by the New York Post, March 24, 2020:1""Seriously sick coronavirus patients in New York state's largest hospital system are being given massive doses of vitamin C … Dr. Andrew G. Weber, a pulmonologist and critical-care specialist affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, said his intensive-care patients with the coronavirus immediately receive 1,500 milligrams of intravenous vitamin C. Identical amounts of the powerful antioxidant are then re-administered three or four times a day, he said … The regimen is based on experimental treatments administered to people with the coronavirus in Shanghai, China.'The patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C,' he said. 'It helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it's not a sexy drug' … Weber … said vitamin C levels in coronavirus patients drop dramatically when they suffer sepsis, an inflammatory response that occurs when their bodies overreact to the infection. 'It makes all the sense in the world to try and maintain this level of vitamin C,' he said.""A Northwell Health spokesperson has reportedly confirmed that vitamin C treatment is being ""widely used"" against coronavirus within the 23-hospital system. According to Weber, vitamin C is being used in conjunction with the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, which have also shown promise in coronavirus treatment.Vitamin C Is a Vastly Underutilized Antiviral 'Drug'According to Dr. Ronald Hunninghake, an internationally recognized expert on vitamin C who has personally supervised tens of thousands of intravenous (IV) vitamin C administrations, vitamin C is ""definitely a very underutilized modality in infectious disease,"" considering ""it's really a premiere treatment"" for infections.
In my interview with him, Hunninghake suggested one of the reasons why conventional medicine has been so slow to recognize the importance of vitamin C has to do with the fact that they've been looking at it as a mere vitamin, when in fact it's a potent oxidizing agent that can help eliminate pathogens when given in high doses. There are also financial factors. In short, it's too inexpensive. Conventional medicine, as a general rule, is notoriously uninterested in solutions that cannot produce significant profits. One of the primary reasons we're now seeing its use against COVID-19 is undoubtedly because we had no expensive drugs in the medical arsenal that could be turned to.In my March 17, 2020, interview with Dr. Andrew Saul, editor-in-chief of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, he mentions being in contact with a South Korean medical doctor who is giving patients and medical staff an injection of 100,000 IUs of vitamin D along with as much as 24,000 mg (24 grams) of IV vitamin C. ""He's reporting that these people are getting well in a matter of days,"" Saul says. As explained by Saul, vitamin C at extremely high doses acts as an antiviral drug, actually killing viruses. While it does have anti-inflammatory activity, which helps prevent the massive cytokine cascade associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, it's antiviral capacity likely has more to do with it being a non-rate-limited free radical scavenger. As explained by Saul in our interview:""Cathcart's view is that you simply push in vitamin C to provide the electrons to reduce the free radicals. This is the way Cathcart and Levy look at vitamin C's function (at very high doses) as an antiviral. At modest doses, normal supplemental doses … vitamin C strengthens the immune system because the white blood cells need it to work. White blood cells carry around in them a lot of vitamin C … So, vitamin C is very well-known to directly beef up the immune system through the white blood cells.""",0
"“I am not saying that China deliberately released this, shooting itself in the foot. But it was clear they were developing an extremely dangerous unknown biological weapon that had never been seen before, and it leaked out of the lab… I personally believe that until our political leaders come clean with the American people, both at the White House and in Congress and our state government, and publicly admit that this is an extremely dangerous offensive biological warfare weapon that we are dealing with, I do not see that we will be able to confront it and to stop it, let alone defeat it.” —Dr. Francis Boyle, International Bioweapons Expert, April 15, 2020.According to Johns Hopkins University, as of today, COVID-19 has infected more than 3 million people and killed at least 210,000 worldwide.Those are big numbers, considering the fact that six short months ago, few members of the general public had ever heard of the coronavirus. And almost no one was harboring fears of a looming and deadly global pandemic.But here we are. As our new reality sinks in, as we adjust to lockdowns and home schooling and long lines at grocery stores, as we look for ways to protect ourselves and our families—and as some grieve for lost loved ones—most of us are also seeking answers.Why does this virus cause so many mysterious symptoms? Why are some cases mild, others deadly? How can we protect ourselves? Whose advice should we follow?But the biggest questions of all are these: Where did COVID-19 come from? And how can we prevent this from ever happening again?The answers to these questions may be too disturbing to ponder, especially while we’re still grappling with the impact of the virus on nearly every aspect of our lives.But our failure to investigate, and directly address, the origins of COVID-19 almost certainly guarantees our failure to protect ourselves from future, possibly even more deadly, pandemics.Science most foul.Thousands of dangerous viruses and other pathogens, such as the bat coronavirus and the avian flu, are being collected in the wild by Chinese, U.S. and international researchers. These viruses are then analyzed and weaponized (i.e. genetically engineered, manipulated, recombined) in secretive, accident-prone, labs like the Wuhan Virology Lab in China or the U.S. Army Lab in Fort Detrick, Maryland.Coronaviruses typically have a narrow host range, infecting one or just a few species, such as bats. However, using targeted RNA recombination, gene engineers can manipulate viruses such as COVID-19 for “gain of function” to enable them to infect other species (i.e. human cells), interfere with immune system response and readily spread through the air.A growing arsenal of synthetic viruses have been lab-engineered, despite U.S. and international laws banning biowarfare weapons and experimentation. A disturbing number of these so-called “dual use” Biowarfare/Biodefense labs have experienced leaks, accidents and thefts over the past three decades
As the well-respected Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists recently warned “A safety breach at a Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab is believed to have caused four suspected SARS cases, including one death, in Beijing in 2004. A similar accident caused 65 lab workers of Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute to be infected with brucellosis in December 2019 . . . In January 2020, a renowned Chinese scientist, Li Ning, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for selling experimental animals to local markets.”China is hardly the only place to experience such accidents. A USA Today investigation in 2016, for instance, revealed an incident involving cascading equipment failures in a decontamination chamber as U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers tried to leave a biosafety level 4 lab. The lab likely stored samples of the viruses causing Ebola and smallpox, according to the report.In 2014, the CDC revealed that staff had accidently sent live anthrax between laboratories, exposing 84 workers. In an investigation, officials found other mishaps that had occurred in the preceding decade.In 2019, the U.S. Army Fort Detrick, Maryland Biological Weapons Lab was temporarily shut down for improper disposal of dangerous pathogens, according to a New York Times report. Officials refused to provide details about the pathogens or the leak, citing “national security” concerns.As Sam Husseini recently reported in Salon magazine, biowarfare engineers in labs such as Wuhan or Fort Detrick are deliberately and recklessly evading international law:“Governments that participate in such biological weapon research generally distinguish between ‘biowarfare’ and ‘biodefense,’ as if to paint such ‘defense’ programs as necessary. But this is rhetorical sleight-of-hand; the two concepts are largely indistinguishable. ‘Biodefense’ implies tacit biowarfare, breeding more dangerous pathogens for the alleged purpose of finding a way to fight them. While this work appears to have succeeded in creating deadly and infectious agents, including deadlier flu strains, such ‘defense’ research is impotent in its ability to defend us from this pandemic.”Activist critics of genetic engineering and biological warfare experiments, including myself, Dr. Mercola and GM Watch, joined now by independent voices in the mass media, are reporting, albeit in some cases reluctantly, that mounting evidence indicates that the deadly COVID-19 virus may have accidentally leaked out of one of the supposedly high-security biowarfare labs (the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Chinese Center for Disease Control) that were analyzing and manipulating bat coronaviruses in Wuhan, China.In order to conceal their scientific malpractice and criminal negligence, to protect their “right” to carry out dangerous, unregulated research, and to safeguard billions of dollars in annual Biopharm and GMO industry profits (Monsanto/Bayer, among others, is now conducting its own biowarfare research), Chinese and U.S. officials, Big Pharma, Facebook, Google and an arrogant and unscrupulous network of global scientists are frantically trying to cover up the lab origins and diabolical machinations of the COVID-19 pandemic.A widely-cited paper, published in the journal Nature on February 3, 2020, claims to establish that SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus of bat origin that naturally jumped the species barrier between bats and humans and was not synthetically constructed in a lab. However, as Mercola.com reports one of the Chinese authors of this article, Dr. Shi Zhengli from the Wuhan Virology Lab, actually worked previously on weaponizing the SARS virus (the progenitor of COVID-19) and has published peer-reviewed articles on the procedures involved in this genetic manipulation.Another oft-cited but problematic article in Nature Medicine (March 17, 2020), co-authored by a bio-entrepreneur industry scientist, has been repeatedly cited by the mass media as offering “proof” that the COVID-19 virus arose “naturally” as opposed to being lab-derived.But recent critiques offered by independent scientists, including the London-based molecular geneticist Dr. Michael Antoniou, a long-time critic of genetic engineering, argue convincingly that the computer-modeling “proof” cited by Nature Medicine offers no proof at all. As GM Watch reports:“Dr. Antoniou told us that while the authors [of the March 17 Nature Medicine article] did indeed show that SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely to have been built by deliberate genetic engineering from a previously used virus backbone, that’s not the only way of constructing a virus. There is another method by which an enhanced-infectivity virus can be engineered in the lab. . .”Antoniou told GM Watch that this method, called “directed iterative evolutionary selection process,” involves using genetic engineering to generate “a large number of randomly mutated versions of the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor,” and then to select those protein receptors most effective at infecting human cells.
As Antoniou points out, the inventors of this technique received the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2018, a fact the authors of the Nature Medicine article surely knew. Did the authors of the Nature Medicine article deliberately leave this more plausible hypothesis out, in order to bolster their questionable thesis that COVID-19 arose naturally—even though biowarfare labs in Wuhan were engineering bat viruses years before the fatal outbreak?If lab technicians in the Wuhan lab did use the directed iterative evolutionary selection process to engineer a “gain of function” (weaponized) bat coronavirus, and the virus subsequently leaked, infected one or more lab technicians, then spread to people outside the lab, including people from the Wuhan Seafood Market, there would be no trace of the virus having been genetically engineered or manipulated.Peer-reviewed, published articles, going back more than a decade, indicate that researchers at the Wuhan Labs (Dr. Shi Zhengli and others) have been carrying out experiments to manipulate and weaponize deadly bat coronavirus so that they can readily infect human cells. In a 2008 article in the Journal of Virology, Zengli and other scientists report on how they have genetically engineered SARS-like viruses from horseshoe bats to enable the viruses to gain entry into human cells.
The powers that be, in Beijing and Washington, like to reassure us that researchers in places like the Wuhan Virology Lab, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control, or the U.S. Army Biological Weapons Lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland are only “studying” (not manipulating or weaponizing) dangerous pathogens like bat coronaviruses, and that security in these government/WHO/NIH-monitored labs is so strict that accidents could never happen.But a number of well-respected scientific critics of genetic engineering and biological warfare have been sounding the alarm for decades.Critics including Francis Boyle (author of the 1989 U.S. Bioterrorism law banning bioweapons research) and Dr. Richard Ebright of Rutgers University’s Waksman Institute of Microbiology, have warned that experiments and manipulations of viruses and pathogens are inherently extremely dangerous, (not to mention that they violate international law), given human error and the fact that security has been dangerously lax in the world’s biowarfare/biodefense laboratories.
Almost too incredible to believe, funding for the reckless germ war experiments in Wuhan have included more than $3 million from Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), with apparent collaboration, according to Boyle, from scientists at the universities of North Carolina, Wisconsin, Harvard and other institutions.In 2014, the Obama White House Office of Science and Technology Policy put a hold or “funding pause” on “gain of function” experimentation on dangerous viruses in U.S. labs due to “biosafety and biosecurity risks.”Yet experimentation apparently continued uninterrupted (with U.S. funding) in China at the Wuhan lab. Then in 2017, the Trump Administration reversed this “funding pause,” essentially allowing illegal germ warfare research to continue.Longtime anti-GMO activists at GM Watch in the UK recently published an article entitled “COVID-19 Could Be a Wake-Up Call for Biosafety.” The article explains how, below the public radar, secretive and reckless research on genetically engineering and weaponizing coronaviruses has been going on for decades:“Stuart Newman, professor of cell biology and anatomy at New York Medical College in Valhalla, New York, editor-in-chief of the journal Biological Theory, and co-author of Biotech Juggernaut, adds crucial historical context that shows exploring whether COVID-19 could have been genetically engineered should not be dismissed as a subject fit only for conspiracy theorists.“[Newman] points out that the genetic engineering of coronaviruses has been going on for a long time. According to Newman, ‘Even most biologists are not aware that virologists have been experimentally recombining and genetically modifying coronaviruses for more than a decade to study their mechanisms of pathogenicity.’ Indeed, Newman points to papers on engineering coronaviruses that go back a full 20 years.” Dr. Peter Breggin points out that in 2015, researchers from the U.S. and China's Wuhan Institute of Virology collaborated to transform an animal coronavirus into one that can attack humans. Breggin’s provocative essay includes a direct link to the original study  which was published in the British journal, Nature.Recent investigative reporting, including an explosive April 14 Washington Post article by Josh Rogin, followed by more muted coverage by CBS News, CNN, the Wall Street Journal, Newsweek and others, have alerted millions of people to the fact that the official Chinese/Big Pharma/WHO/NIH “bat in the market” story about the origins of COVID-19 may no longer be credible.As Rogin’s article points out, officials from the U.S. embassy in Beijing visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology numerous times in early 2018, and tried to warn the Trump Administration that there were serious safety violations in the lab’s handling of bat coronaviruses. The officials were especially concerned that inadequately trained staff and lax security procedures at the lab, jointly funded by the Chinese and U.S., posed a serious risk of unleashing a “new SARS-like pandemic.”
In fact, in 2004, foreshadowing the current disaster, there were two serious accidents at the high-security Beijing Virology lab, infecting two researchers with the dangerous SARS virus.Ebright, who has been speaking out on lab safety since the early 2000s, said this about the dangerous security procedures at the Wuhan labs:“bat coronaviruses at Wuhan [Center for Disease Control] and Wuhan Institute of Virology routinely were collected and studied at BSL-2 {Biosecurity Level 2), which provides only minimal protections against infection of lab workers. Virus collection, culture, isolation, or animal infection at BSL-2 with a virus having the transmission characteristics of the outbreak virus would pose substantial risk of infection of a lab worker, and from the lab worker, the public.”Politics most foul.The Trump Administration did nothing about the repeated warnings from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing in 2018, concerning the dangerous practices at the at the Wuhan Lab. Nor scientists at the NIH and the World Health Organization (WHO) who were supposedly monitoring the lab’s coronavirus experiments. After the outbreak happened, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) silenced or “disappeared” scientists and journalists who had earlier published research or news articles indicating that the COVID-19 virus leaked from a government lab and infected researchers.

As the Canadian journalist Andrew Nikiforuk wrote:

“Faced with the coronavirus threat, Chinese authorities, according to comprehensive reports by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, suppressed whistleblowers, ignored critical evidence and responded so tardily to the outbreak that they moved to compensate for their failures with a draconian lockdown . . .”.
Frantically covering their tracks, the CCP removed every scientific article and news report from the internet and public record which contradicted their official story. Aiding and abetting the CCP/Biopharm cover-up were the gatekeepers at Facebook (now heavily invested in Big Pharma), who censored and removed an article by Steve Mosher, published by the NY Post on Feb. 22, which called the official story into question. Facebook finally unblocked the NY Post article after it was revealed that Facebook’s objective “fact checker,” Danielle E. Anderson, was in fact previously a paid researcher at the same Wuhan lab whose lax security so alarmed State Department officials.Trying hard to cover up the fact that they ignored the repeated warnings of the State Department and intelligence officials, the Trump Administration and the entire U.S. Biopharm and Vaccine Establishment are doing their utmost to uphold the official Chinese-scripted story. Especially troubling to the powers that be is the fact that the criminally negligent Wuhan Lab bat experiments were being funded, at least in part, by Dr. Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, along with the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch—even after these types of germ warfare experiments had been banned in the U.S.Commander-in-Chief Trump himself, in between suggesting people might want to ingest or inject some disinfectants for COVID-19 protection, goes back and forth on the “bat in the market” theory, torn between rousing his populist base by denouncing the “Chinese Virus,” and siding with his good friend, and Corporate America’s most important business partner, Xi Jinping, the Chinese Dictator, who just happens to control not only trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasury Bonds and exports, but the medical equipment, Pharma drugs and lab chemicals that are in such short supply in the U.S.Trump also has millions of dollars in real estate loans coming due from Chinese banks next year.In an Instagram post, Robert Kennedy Jr. exposes the complicity of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the supposed “rational voice” of the Trump Administration on COVID-19, in the Wuhan disaster:“The Daily Mail today reports that it has uncovered documents showing that Anthony Fauci’s NIAID gave $3.7 million to scientists at the Wuhan Lab at the center of Coronavirus leak scrutiny. According to the British paper, ‘the federal grant funded experiments on bats from the caves where the virus is believed to have originated.’ Background: following the 2002-2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak, NIH funded a collaboration by Chinese scientists, U.S. military virologists from the bioweapons lab at Ft. Detrick & NIH scientists from NIAID to prevent future coronavirus outbreaks by studying the evolution of virulent strains from bats in human tissues. Those efforts included ‘gain of function’ research that used a process called ‘accelerated evolution’ to create COVID Pandemic superbugs: enhanced bat borne COVID mutants more lethal and more transmissible than wild COVID. Fauci’s studies alarmed scientists around the globe who complained, according a Dec. 2017 NY Times article that ‘these researchers risk creating a monster germ that could escape the lab and seed a pandemic.’ Dr. Mark Lipsitch of the Harvard School of Public Health’s Communicable Disease Center told the Times that Dr. Fauci’s NIAID experiments ‘have given us some modest scientific knowledge and done almost nothing to improve our preparedness for pandemic, and yet risked creating an accidental pandemic.’ In October 2014, following a series of federal laboratory mishaps that narrowly missed releasing these deadly engineered viruses, President Obama ordered the halt to all federal funding for Fauci’s dangerous experiments. It now appears that Dr. Fauci may have dodged the federal restrictions by shifting the research to the military lab in Wuhan. Congress needs to launch an investigation of NIAD’s mischief in China.”Kennedy also calls out two of the other supposed “health experts” on the Trump team, Robert Redfield and Deborah Birx:“Redfield, Birx & Fauci lead the White House #coronavirus task force. In 1992, two military investigators charged Redfield & Birx with engaging in ‘a systematic pattern of data manipulation, inappropriate statistical analyses & misleading data presentation in an apparent attempt to promote the usefulness of the GP160 AIDS vaccine.’ A subsequent Air Force tribunal on Scientific Fraud and Misconduct agreed that Redfield’s ‘misleading or, possibly, deceptive’ information ‘seriously threatens his credibility as a researcher and has the potential to negatively impact AIDS research funding for military institutions as a whole. His allegedly unethical behavior creates 0 hope and could result in premature deployment of the vaccine.’ The tribunal recommended investigation by a ‘fully independent outside investigative body.’ Dr. Redfield confessed to D.O.D. interrogators and to the tribunal, that his analyses were faulty and deceptive. He agreed to publicly correct them. Afterward, he continued making his 0 claims at 3 subsequent international HIV conferences, & perjured himself in testimony before Congress, swearing that his vaccine cured HIV. Their gambit worked. Based upon his testimony, Congress appropriated $20 million to the military to support Redfield/Birx’s research project.  Public Citizen complained in a 1994 letter to the Congressional Committee’s Henry Waxman that the money caused the Army to kill the investigation & ‘whitewash’ Redfield’s crimes. The fraud propelled Birx & Redfield into stellar careers as health officials. Docs obtained via Tom Paine."" Although the Chinese government and most of the U.S. political establishment continue to support the official “bat in the market” story, the majority of Americans, do not. As reported in the UK’s Sunday Times:“According to a Pew Research poll, only 43 percent think the virus came about naturally, while a sizeable 29 percent  believe it was made in a laboratory.” Journalism most foul. It is frustrating, and indeed alarming, that so few independent journalists, scientists, activists, and public officials have thus far been willing to question the “official story.”For 30 years now, myself and others have warned about the dangers of genetically engineered foods and crops and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in general, including gene-altered bioweapons, gene drives, and the new CRISPR gene-editing technologies.Now it appears that our worst fears have materialized.We need a global public inquiry, led by independent scientists, to gather the evidence on what really happened with COVID-19, followed by an International Biowarfare Crimes Tribunal, so that we can bring the Chinese, U.S. and other perpetrators of this pandemic to justice, and prevent this type of disaster from ever happening again.It’s time to shut down every Biosafety/Biowar lab in the world (including Bayer and Monsanto’s lab) and implement a true global ban on weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), including all atomic, chemical and biological weapons and WMD experimentation.Until we do this, none of us will ever be safe again.The so-called progressive media in America, with a few exceptions, have up until now failed to investigate the real causes of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly out of ignorance of the machinations and arrogant recklessness of the gene engineers and bio-warfare scientists, partly out of fear of appearing to agree with Trump’s racist rantings, or even worse, being branded a “conspiracy theorist” by Establishment Democrats and mass media outlets.And speaking of conspiracies and murder most foul, almost everyone seems to have forgotten about the nationwide panic surrounding the post-9/11 2001 anthrax bioterrorist attacks—used to help justify the invasion of Iraq—against liberal members of the media and the U.S. Congress. Then and now, it was clear that these attacks were carried out not by Arab terrorists, nor a single crazed individual, but by a yet unidentified cabal who engineered and deployed weaponized spores from the U.S. military biowarfare lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland.But perhaps you think we shouldn’t worry so much, since a blockbuster lineup of anti-COVID vaccines are on the way, funded by the Chinese government, Big Pharma and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, likely including some of the same gene engineers who weaponized COVID-19?Never mind that Bill Gates, Monsanto, the Gene Giants and Big Pharma appear quite willing to join up with Facebook and Google to implement a 24/7 totalitarian medical surveillance state, with everyone injected with a mandatory and expensive COVID-19 vaccine, while the world’s dictators, corporate criminals and billionaires hunker down in their underground mansions and bunkers.Never mind that most flu vaccines up until now don’t work that well, especially against constantly mutating viruses like COVID-19, or that they’re routinely laced with aluminum adjuvants and mercury preservatives.Never mind that perhaps our only real defense against biowarfare is to stop eating Big Ag and Big Food’s poison products, and instead strengthen our health and our immune systems, clean up the world’s air, water and environment, shut down factory farms, stop destroying wildlife habitat and pray that herd immunity eventually stops the spread of COVID-19, since so many of us have already been infected, but are asymptomatic.In the meantime, please don’t believe everything you read in the corporate mass media, Facebook or even the progressive press. Stay in touch with and support those of us determined to seek and defend the truth, fight for freedom and justice, and organize for a regenerative future and climate.Don’t forget to eat healthy, organic, regenerative foods, take your immune-boosting supplements, get as much exercise, fresh air and sunshine as possible, wash your hands frequently, stay safe, and stay out of the way of those most vulnerable.Please sign our petition demanding an end to genetic engineering of viruses.",0

"Exceptional situations like the current Covid 19 pandemic unsettle and scare many people. Doubts and questions are often branded as ""conspiracy theory"". The ""Handelsblatt"" has now written: ""Bill Gates: The Man Who Predicted the Corona Pandemic"". But it ignored a not unimportant fact.Rumors already circulated in January that the world's second richest person, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, could have something to do with the outbreak of the new Sars-Cov-2 virus from the family of corona viruses and the resulting disease Covid-19 . It was pointed out that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was involved in the pandemic simulation game ""Event 201"" on October 18, 2019 in New York. Shortly afterwards, the outbreak of the new virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan was reported, which has meanwhile global consequences.Uno plans to establish global coronavirus control foundation - Oslo.A number of established media quickly tried to refute this rumor about gates in so-called fact checks. It also referred to a message from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security of the university of the same name, which was also involved in the business game, on January 24. It was called it: ""The scenario we have modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we have explicitly stated that this is not a prediction."" After all went digital ""sandbox exercise"" of 65 million deaths worldwide from. This was not predicted for the actual corona pandemic, it was emphasized afterwards.Now , on March 19, the newspaper ""Handelsblatt"" published an article entitled ""Bill Gates: The Man Who Predicted the Corona Pandemic"". However, no reference is made to the business game. Instead, attention was drawn to a post, the gates in the medical journal ""New England Journal of Medicine"" (NEJM) published had. In the text of February 28, the billionaire specifically addressed the Covid 19 outbreak and asked if it could be the “pandemic of the century”.
Covid-19 like ""Spanish flu""?The ""Handelsblatt"" recalled: ""The man who wrote the article in the NEJM is not a medical doctor or virologist, he has no degree. And yet the experts are listening to Bill Gates. ”This is because Gates“ has acquired a reputation as the greatest benefactor among the billionaires of the world with its foundation, which specializes in health initiatives ”.The Microsoft founder referred to the 1918 influenza epidemic, known as the ""Spanish flu"", with millions of deaths worldwide. He says Covid-19 is a similar threat. ""I hope it's not that bad, but we should assume that it will be until we know something else."" One of the reasons Gates explains is that the new virus is more contagious than the original Sars virus.Gates is particularly worried about the countries with low to medium national incomes, especially poor countries, given the global spread. Their health care system is “thinned out”, which means that the new coronavirus can spread quickly there. But industrialized countries have had the problem for a long time as a result of the neoliberal austerity and privatization policies that have been going on for decades. Gates does not comment on this.Deadly austerity programs.In 2014, the two health economists David Stuckler and Sanjay Basu showed in their book “ Killing austerity programs” what consequences these have for those affected worldwide. ""Our finding is that the real danger to the health of the general public does not lurk in recessions per se, but in the austerity programs with which they are often 'combated'."" The authors have demonstrated this using the example of various countries. Your book can at least help you understand the different starting points, since not all states followed the deadly austerity measures.Home lessons. ""Curfews are the wrong way"" - Renowned virologist on the corona crisis.Back to Gates: In his article in the British specialist magazine, he calls for more spending on medical research and health systems, especially in the weaker countries. And: ""But we also need major systemic changes so that we can react more efficiently and effectively when the next epidemic occurs."" The billionaire is particularly demanding that more money be invested in the research of new, safe and effective vaccines.But he also emphasizes that vaccines and virus-inhibiting substances “should not simply be sold to the highest bidder”. They should be ""available and affordable"" for all concerned. Such a distribution they ""the right strategy"" to curb the current spread of Covid-19 and prevent future pandemics.Everything just a coincidence?Hardly anyone will contradict Gates' noble goals. The problem is certainly that even as a result of the neoliberal austerity policies, super-rich people like him are now taking on tasks that states and governments actually have in international cooperation. The credibility of such calls is constantly being questioned.In its article, the Handelsblatt points out that Gates has invested a lot of money in promising biotech companies - for example in the German company Curevac. ""The Gates Foundation invested $ 52 million in the Tübingen company five years ago to support the development of vaccines against malaria."" But the company is now involved in the search for a vaccine against the new corona virus. It is considered so promising that, according to reports, US President Donald Trump wanted to buy the Curevac results exclusively for the United States.When Sputniknews asked, a spokesman for the company said: “The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation holds shares in CureVac, we do not provide information about their amount. Mr. Gates has no direct influence on the company, but there are always votes with his foundation. ""Billionaire Gates will certainly not be upset if the Curevac research is successful and governments buy vaccines against the new virus from the Tübingen company. It is surely a coincidence that he is a partner in Curevac and that his foundation co-hosted a pandemic simulation game shortly before Covid-19 actually broke out. Likewise that according to the ""Handelsblatt"" he ""predicted"" the pandemic. But it looks strange and invites you to ask questions.",0
"The coronavirus pandemic is exaggerated in order to turn countries into fascist hygiene dictatorships.No one is surprised why neither doctors in private practice nor the pneumological and intensive care units of our hospitals continue to report any worrying increase in serious respiratory diseases. No one wonders why throughout Europe, even in Italy and Spain, death rates are not soaring but are actually lower than in previous years. Hardly anyone listens to the well-founded, factual concerns of many doctors and scientists, who are alienated, even horrified, by the corona hype – and if they are, they seem to lack the courage to make a big deal out of what they have heard.What incompetent, expert, hyperactive governments worldwide are doing with disproportionate protection against epidemics is turning whole countries into prisons, liberal democracies into fascist hygiene dictatorships.The WHO has long been on the receiving end of the pharmaceutical industry, 85 percent of which is financed through grants from big pharmaceutical companies and related foundations, in particular the Gates Foundation.",0
"Because of the coronavirus, the World Health Organization has declared an emergency of international importance. Countries close borders one after another. In Russia, they restrict traffic at checkpoints on the border with China and Mongolia, passenger rail services are stopped, and air traffic is limited.
Cases of infection have already been recorded in 23 states. Now, on this list, Russia, however, is again sick of the citizens of China.“A patient with coronavirus infection is in a special ward. The patient was suspected with suspicion on the day of crossing the border, ”said Svetlana Lapa, head of the Rospotrebnadzor for the Trans-Baikal Territory.The number of infected around the world exceeded 14 thousand people, another 20 thousand - under suspicion. More than 90 percent is accounted for by China itself, more than 300 people became victims of the virus. Immediately in 31 provinces of China, an emergency regime was introduced.A virus vaccine is already being developed, including by our scientists. The Russian Ministry of Health has prepared recommendations to prevent the spread of infection.The leadership of the country is following the epidemic, a special headquarters has been formed, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. The protective measures that are being taken in the regions are reported directly to the Russian leader Vladimir Putin.The President ordered the evacuation of citizens of our country from the most infected regions with the help of the Russian Aerospace Forces. The first airplanes of the Ministry of Defense are ready to fly to the epicenter country. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin decided to close ground checkpoints in the Far East, and the Russians immediately removed from China.The checkpoint is closed, which is why a kilometer-long queue of heavy trucks has accumulated here. And now a bus is passing by us - there are tourists in it, who urgently had to be evacuated from China, ”Zvezda correspondent Denis Ivlev reports from the border.  
Sophia Horova is studying in Harbin. She was among those hundred Russians who were urgently returned to their homeland by bus. She admits that it was unexpected for her.“They didn’t tell us anything until the last. On the contrary, it was assumed that we would stay until March until the border was opened, ”Sofia said.At the border crossings, all passengers underwent careful control - checking with thermal imagers, examination by doctors. There were some difficulties - two people were unhealthy. They found a high fever, which is the first symptom of a coronavirus. Just a few hours later, the test showed that tourists had an ordinary SARS, but doctors were required to play it safe.Today, response measures are also being taken at regional levels. In the border region with the province of Heilongjiang Blagoveshchensk, a “mask” regime was introduced for schoolchildren.In Vladivostok, they prepared special isolated rooms for potential infected people, they also do tests to identify coronavirus and carry out all the necessary procedures to monitor the condition of patients and prevent further spread of the disease.The once-bustling Chinese market in Vladivostok is now empty. Even before the epidemic, all the merchants left for their homeland to celebrate the Eastern New Year, but the holidays will soon end, and if the border is opened, Chinese citizens will begin to return en masse to Russia, including from the infected areas of China.Mikhail Schelkanov, doctor of biological sciences, professor at the FEFU School of Biomedicine and head of the virology laboratory of the Federal Research Center for Biodiversity of the Far Eastern Branch of the Academy of Sciences knows everything about viruses. He has worked with hundreds of diseases, including Ebola. I am sure that the return of Chinese citizens to Russia should not be harmful.“I see no reason to panic. If you look at the incidence rate, even if it is relative to the population of Hubei Province, you will see that this is a tiny percentage. The level of deaths from patients at the level of 2-3%. With all the cynicism, this is a very low percentage. And we must take into account that the spread rate is much lower than the same flu that we are familiar with, ”Mikhail Shchelkanov explains.There are many theories about the origin of coronavirus and the further development of events. The most popular one concerns the monstrous prediction of Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. Last year, he said that 33 million people could die from such a coronavirus in 250 days. The calculations are purely mathematical, but true, the IT tycoon is sure.After such statements, adherents of conspiracy theories literally have no doubt that the virus is of artificial origin, and Bill Gates is one of its main sponsors. Another fact adds weight to this theory - a few months ago, the head of Microsoft held a conditional exercise called Event 201, which simulated an outbreak of a new virus that killed 65 million people in 18 months. The idea of ​​the teachings is simple - globalization for salvation.""So, let's begin. The world has been seized by a global pandemic. And only well-coordinated work of states and big business can stop it. ”It is noteworthy that the famous pharmaceutical giants and the Pentagon leadership participated in this theater of cruel cynicism.“This cannot be a coincidence, when the exercises were conducted, the coronavirus did not exist. Either it should be Nostradamus, or the person who created it. Therefore, these exercises are no longer even indirectly, but directly confirm Gates’s involvement in this story, ”said Dmitry Zhuravlev, political scientist and director of the Institute for Regional Problems.The fact is that while the disease affects only the representatives of the Mongoloid race, such suspicious selectivity raises questions from experts. No less widespread discussion was caused by the story around the laboratory for the study of dangerous viruses. It is located in Wuhan, 32 kilometers from the same market where the disease was first recorded.However, there is another biolaboratory in Wuhan - until recently, nothing was known about it. Her address is like someone’s joke - Gaoxin, three sixes - the number mentioned in the Bible, under which the name of the beast of the Apocalypse is hidden. But it’s even more symbolic that it exists on the money of the famous banker Jorozh Soros, who shares the globalist ideas of Bill Gates. It would seem that nuclear conspiracy theology is completely different, but experts say that a tricky plan lies behind the absurd wrapper.“She is not only Soros, but also Chinese. And that might work. 11 million people - times. Chinese responsibility is higher. If the virus escapes, then China will respond. And the United States and Soros will be out of business. A very good plan, ”adds Dmitry Zhuravlev.Economists claim that the outbreak of a new virus could cause another economic crisis. Trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is accompanied by a decline in quotations. Assets related to tourism, trade, gambling and transport are falling. But at the same time there are those who benefit from the coronavirus.“Any pharmaceutical company that is involved in the development of epidemiology-related medicines — be it vaccines, antibiotics, immunomodulators — anything that can be considered a treatment for influenza — it benefits from this. It’s just like two or two, ”said Alexander Saversky, president of the Patients League, member of the expert council under the Russian government.Some ""marketing geniuses"" decided that the epidemic is a good reason to rebrand a simple SARS. Pharmacies are actively selling antiviral and immunomodulating drugs with the slogans ""Protect yourself from coronavirus."" One thing is clear, those who benefit from the disease will continue to fuel mass hysteria. After all, a set of pills, sprays and potions can be sold well, and common sense is free. Wash your hands after the street and if you have symptoms of illness, consult a doctor - that’s all.However, on a deadly virus, you can earn not only money, but also subscribers. Bloggers and just active users of social networks, taking advantage of the moment, shoot provocative videos that sometimes scare people, to put it mildly.Such cynical humor allow themselves and the federal media. The cartoonist of the famous Danish publication Jyllands-Posten, Niels Bo Boysen, redrawed the flag of China, removing yellow stars from it and replacing them with images of the virus. China even demanded a formal apology, but received a refusal from the media leadership. Like, this is not a mockery of the victims, it is in Europe - freedom of speech.But the French publication Agora is ironic over itself: on a caricature, the reaction of society to coronavirus and flu. The first - did not take a single life in France, but is perceived as the end of the world, the second - kills 10 thousand French every year, but no one pays attention to it.",0

"Washington benefits from new SARS unsettling major competitors. Prior to the advent of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, the so-called “first package” of the US-China trade agreement, which was signed on behalf of the Celestial Empire by Vice-Premier of the State Council of the PRC Liu He, was a tactical move that would allow China to take a break. And there is the presidential election in the United States, and it remains to be seen whether Donald Trump will be able to gain a foothold in the Oval Office for a second term ... But it looks like a malicious virus that has matured either in the stomachs of bats or in a snake’s gut has confused all the cards to a friend Xi Jinping.Against the background of alarming reports from the Chinese province of Hubei (when this material was being prepared, more than 4.5 thousand people fell ill with pneumonia, and 106 died, and these are not final numbers. - Auth.) Copper and iron ore prices collapsed.Copper cheaper ten days in a row, and yesterday the price fell by 1.5% - up to 5834.5 dollars per ton. Iron ore futures are falling in price, on Tuesday at the Singapore auction they offered 85 dollars per ton - a decrease of 6.4%. But, as Bloomberg predicts, $ 80 per tonne is not such a distant prospect. Prices for black gold also plummeted - April futures for the North Sea Brent oil mix were already trading below $ 58 per barrel.At the same time, the Fitch rating agency cautiously reports that the spread of coronavirus will first of all have a negative impact on the economies of Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore, since in these countries the most vulnerable regions to the epidemics are tourism and the service sector. The statement is indisputable - everyone will get it, and yet China, presumably, is more than others, since it is the Chinese economy that is the main consumer of both metals and energy resources, and tourism with services is not the last source of replenishment of the treasury. And since the prices of these goods went down, the Chinese economy also caught the “virus”. And it’s easier to negotiate with a “sick” client, which is well known even without Trump.It is noteworthy that 2019-nCoV got to the American technological giant Apple, whose production facilities are located just 500 kilometers from the “homeland” of the coronavirus - the Wuhan metropolis. And now, according to the Nikkei Asian Review, the production of popular iPhone smartphones is in jeopardy. Starbucks also found itself in a difficult situation, which, due to quarantine, had to close a large half of its four thousand coffee houses operating in China (by the way, this is the second largest market after the United States). But at the same time, the Americans for some reason do not look like such victims of the epidemic, especially Apple, whose leadership at the very beginning of the trade and economic confrontation with China advised to evacuate production facilities in the United States. It seems as if President Trump saw everything in advance, like Wolf Messing or old Wang. However, both Apple and Starbucks were really out of luck. You can’t say the same about the American political establishment, which is making titanic efforts to bring to its knees the ""presumptuous China."" And why should these efforts necessarily be economic in nature? The main question is - who benefits from another SARS unsettling a competitor? If we apply the well-known trick highly likely, unceremoniously used by the British ex-prime minister Theresa May to hang the so-called Skripals poisoning in Russia, then the answer is obvious: the coronavirus epidemic 2019-nCoV, which hit China, is highly likely on the hand of the United States. And the worse for Beijing, the better for Washington. Moreover, the outlook for the epidemic is not yet encouraging. For example, some experts argue: if the spread of 2019-nCoV cannot be stopped, up to 250 million Chinese can become victims of the virus, which is almost two in number in Russia.By the way, about the prospects. The Cepi Global Vaccine Coalition has reportedly invested a total of $ 12.5 million in three projects, in which researchers are ready to expeditiously develop the 2019-nCoV vaccine.Scientists from the Australian University of Queensland, as well as two American biotechnology companies Inovio and Moderna, participate in the work. The American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is also involved. And it seems that microbiologists from Hong Kong have already developed a vaccine against the new coronavirus, as Professor of Hong Kong University Ewan Kwok-Jung hastened to inform the newspaper South China Morning Post. But her research, he claims, could take more than a year. German Shipulin, the deputy director of the Center for Strategic Planning of the Russian Ministry of Health, does not promise an imminent victory over 2019-nCoV. So the hands of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV can be considered as yet untied, and there are suspicions that the United States may be involved in this epidemic. In the Russian media, this assumption has already been made.
US operations as part of a biological warfare against the entire planet.As a result of the dengue epidemic in Cuba from 1978-1981, up to 500 thousand people were affected. Fidel Castro said this was the result of an American biological attack. Washington did not confirm or refute the allegations of the Cuban leader.Pentagon bio laboratories exist in 25 countries around the world. They are funded by the Military Threat Reduction Agency under a $ 2.1 billion military program. The joint biological interaction program includes laboratories located in the countries of the former Soviet Union, such as Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, as well as in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.By the location of these biological laboratories, we can confidently indicate the four countries and territories against which the American biological threats are now directed, these are Russia, Iran, China and the countries of Central and West Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The American company CH2M Hill, under contracts for the Pentagon bio-laboratories in Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, was funded in the amount of $ 341.5 million. Of this amount, almost half ($ 161.1 million) was allocated for research in Lugar Center in Tbilisi. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Its subcontractor, the private company Battelle, has worked in Pentagon bio labs in Afghanistan, Armenia, Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. Battelle conducts research, development, testing and evaluation of the use of both highly toxic chemicals and highly pathogenic biological agents for a wide range of US government agencies. The company entered into federal contracts totaling $ 2 billion and ranks 23rd in the list of 100 best US state contractors. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The Pentagon has a very long history of using insects as carriers of disease. According to a partially declassified US Army report of 1981, American scientists conducted a series of experiments on insects. These operations were part of the US Entomological War as part of a biological weapons program. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The report reported two scenarios: 16 simultaneous attacks on the city by A. Aegypti mosquitoes infected with yellow fever, as well as Tularemia aerosol attack, and assessed their effectiveness in cash and loss of life. The results were very cynical. Pentagon experts were able to ""kill"" 625 thousand people at a cost of $ 0.29 per unit. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Operation Big Itch: Field trials were carried out to determine the coverage and survivability of tropical rat fleas Xenopsylla cheopis for use as a disease carrier in biological warfare. In Ashington neither confirmed nor refuted this information.Operation Big Buzz: 1 million A. Aegypti mosquitoes were raised. One third of them were placed in ammunition, dropped from aircraft and scattered on the ground. Mosquitoes survived in the air and actively sought human blood. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Operations on military experiments with tropical mosquitoes and ticks in Georgia. These types of mosquitoes and fleas (which were studied in the past as part of the US Entomological War Program) were imported into Georgia and tested at the Lugar Center. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Anthrax is one of the biological agents in service with the US Army, not only in the past. Despite Pentagon claims that this program is only defensive, there are facts to the contrary. In 2016, at the Lugar Center, American scientists conducted the study “Genome Sequence of the Soviet / Russian Bacillus anthracis Vaccine Strain 55-VNIIVViM” (the sequence of the Soviet / Russian anthracite cancer vaccine in Russia), which was funded by the US Agency for Biological Weapons Sharing Program Threat Reduction (DTRA) in Tbilisi, and implemented by Metabiota. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by the tick-borne virus Nairovirus (Nairovirus). The disease was first described in Crimea in 1944 and was called Crimean hemorrhagic fever. Later, it caused an epidemic in the Congo in 1969. In 2014, 34 people were infected with the CCHF, including a 4-year-old child, three of whom died. Pentagon biologists are currently studying the virus in Georgia as part of the DTRA project, Epidemiology of febrile illnesses caused by Dengue viruses and other Arboviruses in Georgia. The project included trials on patients with fever symptoms and collection of ticks as possible distributors of CCHV for laboratory analysis. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Similar CCHV outbreaks occurred in Afghanistan, where there are 3 Pentagon bio labs. As of December 2017, 237 cases of CCHV were reported in this country, 41 of which were fatal. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Bats are also being investigated as a carrier of various diseases at the Lugar Center, which scientists say are carriers of the Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and other deadly diseases. As of June 2017, 1980 cases were recorded with 699 deaths in 19 countries worldwide caused by MERS-CoV. This virus is designed and manufactured in the USA. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Another weapon of bioterrorism is, according to a 1981 US Army report, Tularemia developed in the USA, or Rabbit Fever. New tularemia carriers, such as ticks and rodents, are currently being developed. DTRA has launched a number of projects on Tularemia and in Georgia at the Lugar Center. Highly pathogenic agents (EDP) can be used for military purposes. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.
Ukraine itself does not have control over military biological laboratories on its territory. Under the 2005 Agreement between the US Department of Defense and the Department of Health of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government is prohibited from publicly disclosing confidential information about the US program. Ukraine is also required to transfer all dangerous pathogens to the US Department of Defense for biological research. Under this Agreement, the Pentagon was granted access to many state secrets of Ukraine. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The Pentagon has invested at least $ 65 million in gene editing research. The U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has provided seven research teams to develop tools for altering the genome of insects, rodents, and bacteria through the DARPA Safe Gene program using new CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The worst biological weapon that may have already been used and possibly used in Russia is, again, perhaps used against the “enemy” of the USA - China. Until recently, ethnic biological weapons (biogenetic weapons) were theoretical weapons, the purpose of which is, first of all, to harm people of certain ethnic groups or genotypes (Russians, Chinese, etc.). Although officially the research and development of ethnic bio-weapons has never been publicly confirmed, documents show that the United States collects biological materials from certain ethnic groups - Russians and Chinese. American National Socialism in its purest form.US Air Force specifically collects samples of Russian DNA and synovial tissue, which causes concern in Moscow about a hidden American program for the use of biological weapons.Senator Franz Klintsevich commented on the words of President Vladimir Putin about the purposeful collection of Russian biomaterial: “In the West, everything is done very scrupulously and verified to the smallest detail: if we use biological weapons, then surely ... The relevant services in the West should know that we are aware of their interest. Let those who are engaged in this work on the territory of the Russian Federation not be offended. ”And it cannot be said that such suspicions have no reason. As you know, the United States ratified the Geneva Protocol and the Biological Weapons Convention back in 1975. But the biological games overseas have not stopped, and not only in the national territory. Already after the collapse of the USSR, American biological laboratories appeared, which is precisely established in Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Where else - except that the State Department knows that it is, they say, absolutely peaceful organizations involved in the development of medicines. But if they are so peaceful, then why, one wonders, did the Americans build them not at home, but at the other end of the world?And the participants of the “visiting” American biological project are very specialized. For example, the US Army Institute of Infectious Disease Medical Research (USAMRIID, Fort Detrick), the Military Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which is a division of the Pentagon, the Central Asian and Caucasian Biosafety Association, which monitors the biological potential of the CIS countries, the Biological Threat Reduction Program (Nunn-Lugar program) and so on.Comments, as they say, are unnecessary. Not so long ago, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation analyzed documents on the activities of the so-called ""health center"" that the Americans built in Georgia, and came to the conclusion: in fact, this is a ""death factory"", which killed 73 people who were used by overseas biologists as experimental rabbits. But the fact of the matter is that American bio-laboratories are scattered not only around Russia, but also around the world, where America has its own interests.And another question, where did the 2019-nCoV coronavirus originate - in a bat or in some American ""health center""? Where is it more highly likely?",0
"Occasionally, humanity is confronted with a series of events, oftentimes accompanied with tremendous human suffering, that appear to be so intricately linked and coordinated that to explain them as mere coincidence or conspiracy theory is not only reckless, but potentially criminal in itself.This month a petition was drafted for the federal government to call on Congress to investigate the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for “medical malpractice & crimes against humanity.”“As we look at events surrounding the ‘COVID-19 pandemic,” the appeal reads, “various questions remain unanswered.”“On Oct. 18th of 2019, only weeks prior to ground zero being declared in Wuhan, China, two major events took place. One is ‘Event 201,’ the other is the ‘Military World Games,’ held in none other than Wuhan. Since then a worldwide push for vaccines & biometric tracking has been initiated.”Already the petition has received over 450,000 signatures, far surpassing the 100,000 need for the president to take action on the issue.Although many people may have heard about Event 201, they may not be familiar with all of its details. Thus, it is crucial to examine what exactly took place at the event to see if there are any grounds for this public call for an investigation.Event 201.On October 18, 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, an exercise that entailed a simulated outbreak of a coronavirus “transmitted from bats to people that eventually becomes…transmissible from person to person, leading to a severe pandemic.” Sound familiar? Well, the similarities between the simulated event and our present grim reality do not end there.During the three-and-a-half-hour event, 15 representatives from the world of business, government, and public health were tasked with battling against the fictional outbreak, dubbed CAPS, which goes on to kill 65 million people worldwide over a period of 18 months. Here is what we are told about this fictional bug: the disease is transmissible by people with mild symptoms; there is no possibility of a vaccine being available in the first year; there is an antiviral drug that can help the sick but not significantly limit spread of the disease. Again, those are nearly the exact set of real circumstances the global community is presently confronting with Covis-19. But wait, it gets better.The exercise even had its very own ‘fake news’ channel, dubbed GNN, reporting on the minute-by-minute battle against the fictitious outbreak. An Asian-looking news anchor, Chen Huang, provides the following details on the pandemic. Keep in mind, all of this is being acted out 2 months before the real virus makes landfall.
“Public health agencies have issued travel advisories, while some countries have banned travel from the worst affected areas,” Huang reported, with a gleam in her eye. “As a result, the travel industry is taking a huge hit; travel bookings are down 45% and many flights have been cancelled. “A ripple effect is racing through the service sector,” she said, a comment that probably made the crypto-currency community take note. “Governments that rely on travel and tourism as a large part of their economies are being hit particularly hard.”If Huang only knew the half of it.Next, the video returns to the closed door discussion group, as an ominous large-cap headline appears on the screen that reads: ‘TRAVEL AND TRADE RESTRICTIONS ARE HAVING PROFOUND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES’Tom Inglesby from John Hopkins University seemed to be staring into a crystal ball when he asked: “How should national leaders, businesses and international organizations balance the risk of worsening disease that will be caused by the continual movement of people around the world against the risk of profound economic consequence of travel and trade bans?”Martin Knuchel, crisis manager from Lufthansa Airlines was no less prophetic, using the very same terminology being employed today with regards to “essential” and “non-essential” businesses.“What is essential or non-essential travel, we have to clarify this,” Knuchel stated. “Otherwise, if we go down to 20% bookings over a short period, the company will run down, that’s a fact.”Currently, Lufthansa has been forced to idle more than 90% of its fleet since the (real) coronavirus outbreak began in late December 2019.
And then there was Christopher Elias, the smooth-talking head of the Global Development Division of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, discussing the need to secure the supply chains amid the pandemic.“There’s a whole complex set of issues in a highly interdependent world on supply chains that are ‘just in time’,” Elias warned. “We need to think about how much flex there is in that just in time supply chain system and make sure it keeps running.”Well, wouldn’t you know it? Just this week, Tyson Foods, one of the nation’s biggest meat processors, took out a full page ad in the New York Times in which it warned “the food supply chain is breaking.”“As pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close…millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,” John Tyson, Chairman of the Board of Tyson Foods, wrote. “As a result, there will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we are able to reopen our facilities that are currently closed.”But we’ve only just begun to enter the twilight zone.At this point, the exercise is interrupted once again by Chen Huang of GNN for some commentary from ‘David Gamble’, a disagreeable economist with an unfortunate name who represents the world of finance, and Dr. Juan Perez, a more photogenic spokesperson for the world of medicine.In this fake interview, Gamble opens by asking: “What exactly are the risks and benefits of slowing air travel, of staying home from work, closing schools, disrupting supply chains…and interfering with our reliable channels of communication and news.”“When this is all over, some families, some cities, will have suffered more from our intervention than from CAPS,” he predicts, again, with incredible foresight of things to come.In response to Gamble, Dr. Perez says: “Our response should aim to protect every life we can,” a statement few could disagree with. When Gamble retorts by suggesting that those lofty goals must be accomplished by protecting jobs and critical industries, Perez responds with this astounding remark: “As a physician, I am comfortable saying that our health response to CAPS cannot afford to wait for an incredibly complex debate about…history’s most expensive economic bailout.”Incredibly, the actor physician parrots the very same stance that has been taken by governments around the world: ‘Let’s not endanger a single life, but rather keep everyone at home as we shut down the bulk of the global economy, which may or may not be rescued by a bailout.’ The scripted comment by the fake doctor makes it seem as though the health of the global economy has no connection to the health and well-being of people the world over. Nothing could be further removed from the truth.At this point, it needs to be asked: what are the chances that an exercise simulating the outbreak of a global pandemic not only happens just weeks before the real event, but predicts its main features, which include the shutdown of businesses and schools worldwide, the loss of supply chains, as well as the most expensive bailout in history, among other things? At what point does the line separating fact from fiction, truth from lies become so blurred that it demands a criminal investigation?The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the host of the incredibly visionary exercise, may have been entertaining similar questions when it released a statement on the shocking array of coincidences, saying: “Recently, the Center for Health Security has received questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction.”Military World Games, Wuhan. As it turned out, on October 18, the very same day that Event 201 was being carried out in New York City, the Military World Games kicked off in Wuhan, China, which was reportedly ground zero for the outbreak of Covid-19.The 7th International Military Sports Council (CISM) Military World Games were hosted from Oct. 18 to 27, 2019 in Wuhan, capital city of central China’s Hubei Province. It was the first international military sporting competition to be held in China, with nearly 10,000 athletes from over 100 countries competing in 27 sports.
Following the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, conspiracy theories popped up like mushrooms after a summer rain. Chinese newspapers began floating the idea that U.S. athletes competing in the games had unleashed the deadly virus while in Wuhan. The theories point to two things: the lackluster performance by the U.S. athletes, thus proving, according to some Chinese commentators, they were not sent to Wuhan for their physical prowess but rather for something more sinister. Second, their living quarters were close to the Huanan Seafood Market, where the first cluster of Covid-19 was detected on Dec. 31, 2019.So what is the connection to Bill Gates, who was certainly not participating in the Wuhan military games to shield more nefarious actions? On the surface, absolutely nothing. Yet for a philanthropist whose name is connected to nearly every major pharmaceutical company, and dozens of research groups, connections are bound to be made that may mean nothing. At the very least, however, they are worthy of attention.For example, how many people know that there is a patent for the coronavirus? It is owned by The Pirbright Institute, a biological research organization based in Surrey, England. The institute is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It’s important to note, however, that the coronavirus is the generic name for a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that even include some cases of the common cold. Then there are the more lethal strains, like SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, for which The Pirbright Institute, one of many organizations looking to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, does not hold a patent.“The Institute was granted a patent in 2018 which covers the development of an attenuated (weakened) form of the coronavirus that could potentially be used as a vaccine to prevent respiratory diseases in birds, including IBV, and other animals,” a representative from the Pirbright Institute told USA TODAY.One more note on Wuhan. Less than one month after Event 201, and less than a month before the outbreak of Covid-19, Bill Gates appeared in the Netflix series ‘Explained’ with a documentary entitled, ‘The Next Pandemic.’ In it, the Microsoft co-founder warned that a pandemic could emerge from one of China’s many ‘wet markets,’ where shoppers can choose from a wide variety of live fish and animal products.In 2015, Gates also did a TED talk where he warned that the next catastrophe would not come from missiles, but rather microbes.So if Bill Gates seems to have the best interests of the world at heart, why is he so mistrusted?Why can’t we trust Bill?On March 13, Bill Gates announced he was stepping down from the board of Microsoft Corp., the company he co-founded in 1975, to devote more time to philanthropy.Since then, this technocrat in a wool sweater, who seems to be trying to channel the trust and tenderness of a Fred Rogers, regularly addresses prison planet from his mainstream media soapbox about how he is now devoted to making “vaccines in large quantities.” And, despite having neither scientific credentials nor an elected political post, Gates nevertheless has warned that mass gatherings “may not come back at all” without a vaccine.Apparently the time-honored biological function known as ‘herd immunity,’ which has worked fine for millennia against disease, is now considered out of fashion. Is that because it costs absolutely nothing, least of all in terms of our freedom and liberty? But I digress.Here is Gates lecturing in the Washington Post on April 1st: “The country’s leaders need to be clear: Shutdown anywhere means shutdown everywhere. Until the case numbers start to go down across America — which could take 10 weeks or more — no one can continue business as usual or relax the shutdown. Any confusion about this point will only extend the economic pain, raise the odds that the virus will return, and cause more deaths.”Needless to say, such non-professional advice is infuriating many Americans as opportunistic officials reveal their authoritarian impulses, unleashing a number of draconian lock-down orders, from prohibiting the mowing of lawns to banning swimming at the beach to snitching on family, friends and strangers for breaking with social-distancing decorum.So what do real doctors say about the coronavirus and the lockdown orders, which threaten to trigger a global depression? Many are totally dumbfounded by the decision. Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Dr. Eran Bendavid and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, professors of medicine at Standford University expressed strong reservations over the lockdown, pointing to “deeply flawed” mortality projections rates for COVID-19.“Fear of Covid-19 is based on its high estimated case fatality rate—2% to 4% of people with confirmed Covid-19 have died, according to the World Health Organization and others,” Bendavid and Bhattacharya explained in their article, dated March 24. “So if 100 million Americans ultimately get the disease, two million to four million could die. We believe that estimate is deeply flawed. The true fatality rate is the portion of those infected who die, not the deaths from identified positive cases.”Not only does Bill Gates’ relentless push for a global vaccine against Covid-19 carry the scent of greed, especially when it is considered how heavily invested he is in its development, but the computer engineer turned ‘medical expert’ seems overly enthusiastic over vaccines that carry biometric surveillance technology.While many people would probably have little qualms about rolling up their sleeve for a vaccination that protects them from a deadly virus, many would certainly question the added-on feature of tracking technology that would give the powers-that-be total control over every person.Not only does Gates support the creation of a “national tracking system” to tag the infected, but Microsoft is among the founding members of ID2020, a San Francisco-based biometric company that recently announced it was undertaking a new project that involves the “exploration of multiple biometric identification technologies for infants” that is based on “infant immunization” and only uses the “most successful approaches”.Can it get creepier than that? Unfortunately, yes it can.Two weeks after Bill Gates left the board of Microsoft, the company received a patent for a ‘cryptocurrency system body activity data.’ Although the details on the technology are truly shocking the patent number also had conspiracy theorists in an uproar: WO2020060606. It didn’t take much for Internet sleuths, not to mention Bible enthusiasts, to say this stood for: ‘World Order 2020 666.’Of all the millions of patent numbers that could have been used, why this one? As is the case with customized license plate numbers, did Gates personally request such a configuration that was bound to trigger fear and suspicion – in the middle of a pandemic, no less?Although the cryptocurrency invention makes no specific mention of nanotechnology injected under the skin, possibly together with a vaccine, the opaque description doesn’t rule it out either: “The cryptocurrency system communicatively coupled to the device of the user may verify if the body activity data satisfies one or more conditions set by the cryptocurrency system, and award cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified”.Judging by this and other such activities on the part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, it becomes easier to understand why so many people fear the very worst about their true goals. Whether that high level of distrust should translate into a federal investigation, that is a question best left to the reader to decide.",0
"This April 16th, Dr. Luc Montagnier became a household name around the world. This occurred as the controversial virologist decided to publicly state his support for the theory that Covid-19 is indeed a laboratory-generated creation and not a naturally occurring effect of viral evolution.Referring to a study published at the Kusama School of Biology in New Dehli on January 31st, Montagnier (the 2008 Nobel Prize winner for his 1983 discovery of the HIV virus) made the point that the specific occurrence of HIV RNA viral segments spliced surgically within the COVID-19 genome could not have originated naturally and he described it in the following words:“We have carefully analyzed the description of the genome of this RNA virus. We weren’t the first, a group of Indian researchers tried to publish a study showing that the complete genome of this virus that has within the sequences of another virus: that of HIV.”While the Indian team was induced to retract their publication under immense pressure from the mainstream medical establishment (which never bothered to seriously refute the content of the study’s research but rather used the “random-mutation-makes-anything-possible” argument), Montagnier stated “scientific truth always emerges”.Not China: Montagnier Misdiagnoses the Culprit.Montagnier’s political ignorance became all too clear when he was asked who the culprit could possibly be.By asserting his belief that China’s BSL4 lab in Wuhan was the source, Montagnier has fallen into a trap set by Anglo-American Intelligence circles which have been promoting a military confrontation between the USA and China for a very long time.Now even though Montagnier denies that China released this virus with malicious intent (unlike many fanatical droves of neoconservatives currently itching for war), the “Wuhan Lab origin” hypothesis completely ignores the reality of the Pentagon’s globally extended 25 bioweapons laboratories which have openly created novel coronaviruses including varieties that arose in bats as journalist Whitney Webb’s remarkable February 2020 paper demonstrated.
Even though a 2014-2017 temporary ban on “dual-use” funding was imposed onto America’s bioweapons research, nothing prevented this work from occurring internationally or even covertly within the 11 military labs on American soil itself and tied to the same Fort Detrick that was shut down in July 2019 under suspicious circumstances. As I pointed out in my previous paper The Project for a New American Century, 9/11 and Bioweapons, over $50 billion has been spent on bioweapons research since 2001 which the Project for a New American Century manifesto claimed would play a major role in the arsenal of 21st century warfare stating: “advanced forms of biological warfare that can “target” specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool”.Luc Montagnier’s Wave Therapy: Quackery or Brilliance?The most powerful aspect of Montagnier’s April 16th intervention into world politics in my view is not really found in his support for the laboratory-origins theory, but rather in the scientist’s often overlooked proposition for an international crash program in something called electromagnetic wave therapy. Rather than investing in vaccines, Montagnier has explained that it were much wiser for nations of the world to launch a crash project into a very different approach to viral treatments than is currently common in polite society saying:“I think we can make interference waves which are behind the RNA sequences that can eliminate those sequences with waves and consequently stop the pandemic”.Before brushing this off as “quackery” as so many are wont to do, one should keep in mind that President Trump himself has indicated his interest in Montagnier’s approach in his April 23rd briefing telling reporters:“Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous … whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light. And I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but you are going to test it… And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you are going to test it.”While Trump has been vilely attacked as “unscientific” for these utterances, it is only due to the vast ignorance of Montagnier’s incredible discoveries into the electromagnetic properties of life that such mockery can go unchallenged. Montagnier’s innovations into “bleaching therapy” which Trump referenced in the same speech are also much more complex than mainstream detractors assume and has nothing to do with simply “injecting”disinfectants into the blood stream. These therapies are highly interconnected with the electromagnetic waves emitted by certain types of bacteria which Montagnier has discovered to be the most likely driving mechanism to many of the diseases both chronic and acute plaguing humanity. More will be said on that below.What is Optical Biophysics and What did Montagnier Discover?Optical biophysics is the study of the electromagnetic properties of the physics of life. This means paying attention to the light emissions and absorption frequencies from cells, DNA, and molecules of organic matter, how these interface with water (making up over 75% of a human body) and moderated by the nested array of magnetic fields located on the quantum level and stretching up to the galactic level.Not to discount the bio-chemical nature of life which is hegemonic in the health science realm, the optical biophysician asks: which of these is PRIMARY in growth, replication, and division of labor of individual cells or entire species of organisms? Is it the chemical attributes of living matter or the electromagnetic properties?
Let me explain the paradox a bit more.There are approximately 40 trillion highly differentiated cells in the average human body, each performing very specific functions and requiring an immense field of coherence and intercommunication. Every second approximately 10 million of those cells die, to be replaced by 10 million new cells being born. Many of those cells are made up of bacteria, and much of the DNA and RNA within those cells is made up of viruses (mostly dormant), but which can be activated/deactivated by a variety of methods both chemical and electromagnetic.Here’s the big question:HOW might this complex system be maintained by chemical processes alone- either over the course of a day, month or an entire lifetime?The simple physics of motion of enzymes which carry information in the body from one location to another simply doesn’t come close to accounting for the information coordination required among all parts. This is where Montagnier’s research comes in.After winning the 2008 Nobel Prize, Dr. Montagnier published a revolutionary yet heretical 2010 paper called “DNA Waves and Water” which took the medical community by storm. In this paper, Montagnier demonstrated how low frequency electromagnetic radiation within the radio wave part of the spectrum was emitted from bacterial and viral DNA and how said light was able to both organize water and transmit information! The results of his experiments were showcased wonderfully in this 8 min  video:Using a photo-amplifying device invented by Dr. Jacques Benveniste in the 1980s to capture the ultra low light emissions from cells, Montagnier filtered out all particles of bacterial DNA from a tube of water and discovered that the post-filtered solutions containing no material particles continued to emit ultra low frequency waves! This became more fascinating when Montagnier showed that under specific conditions of a 7 Hz background field (the same as the Schumann resonance which naturally occurs between the earth’s surface and the ionosphere), the non-emitting tube of water that had never received organic material could be induced to emit frequencies when placed in close proximity with the emitting tube! Even more interesting is that when base proteins, nucleotides and polymers (building blocks of DNA) were put into the pure water, near perfect clones of the original DNA were formed!Dr. Montagnier and his team hypothesized that the only way for this to happen was if the DNA’s blueprint was somehow imprinted into the very structure of water itself resulting in a form of “water memory” that had earlier been pioneered by Jacques Benveniste, the results of which are showcased in this incredible 2014 documentary “Water Memory”.Just as Benveniste suffered one of the most ugly witch hunts in modern times (led in large measure by Nature Magazine in 1988), Montagnier’s Nobel prize did not protect him from a similar fate as an international slander campaign has followed him over the past 10 years of his life. Nearly 40 Nobel prize winners have signed a petition denouncing Montagnier for his heresy and the great scientist was forced to even flee Europe to escape what he described as a culture of “intellectual terror”. In response to this slander, Montagnier stated to LaCroix magazine:  “I’m used to attacks from these academics who are just retired bureaucrats, closed off from all innovation. I have the scientific proofs of what I say”.Describing the greatest challenges to advancing this research, Montagnier stated:“We have chosen to work with the private sector because no funds could come from public institutions. The Benveniste case has made it so that anyone who takes an interest in the memory of water is considered… I mean it smells of sulphur. It’s Hell.”Casting Montagnier’s Research in a New Light.In a 2011 interview, Dr. Montagnier recapitulated the consequences of his discoveries:“The existence of a harmonic signal emanating from DNA can help to resolve long-standing questions about cell development, for example how the embryo is able to make its manifold transformations, as if guided by an external field. If DNA can communicate its essential information to water by radio frequency, then non-material structures will exist within the watery environment of the living organism, some of them hiding disease signals and others involved in the healthy development of the organism.”With these insights in mind, Montagnier has discovered that many of the frequencies of EM emissions from a wide variety of microbial DNA is also found in the blood plasmas of patients suffering from influenza A, Hepatitis C, and even many neurological diseases not commonly thought of as bacteria-influenced such as Parkinsons, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumathoid Arthritis and Alzheimers. In recent years, Montagnier’s teams even found certain signals in the blood plasmas of people with autism and several varieties of cancers!Over a dozen French doctors have taken Montagnier’s ideas seriously enough to prescribe antibiotics to treat autism over the course of six years and in opposition to conventional theories, have found that amidst 240 patients treated, 4 out of 5 saw their symptoms either dramatically regress or disappear completely!
These results imply again that certain hard-to-detect species of light emitting microbes are closer to the cause of these ills than the modern pharmaceutical industry would like to admit.A New Domain of Thinking: Why Big Pharma Should Be Afraid.As the filmed 2014 experiment demonstrated, Montagnier went even further to demonstrate that the frequencies of wave emissions within a filtrate located in a French laboratory can be recorded and emailed to another laboratory in Italy where that same harmonic recording was infused into tubes of non-emitting water causing the Italian tubes to slowly begin emitting signals! These DNA frequencies were then able to structure the Italian water tubes from the parent source a thousand miles away resulting in a 98% exact DNA replica!Standing as we are, on the cusp of so many exciting breakthroughs in medical science, we should ask: what could these results mean for the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical industrial complex which relies on keeping the world locked into a practice of chemical drugs and vaccines?Speaking to this point, Montagnier stated:“The day that we admit that signals can have tangible effects, we will use them. From that moment on we will be able to treat patients with waves. Therefore it’s a new domain of medicine that people fear of course. Especially the pharmaceutical industry… one day we will be able to treat cancers using frequency waves.”
Montagnier’s friend and collaborator Marc Henry a professor of Chemistry and Quantum Mechanics at the University of Strasbourg stated:“If we treat with frequencies and not with medicines it becomes extremely cost effective regarding the amount of money spent. We spend a lot of money to find the frequencies, but once they have been found, it costs nothing to treat.”Whether produced in a lab as Montagnier asserts or having appeared naturally as Nature Magazine asserts, the fact remains that the current coronavirus pandemic has accelerated a collapse of the world financial system and forced the leaders of the world to discuss the reality of a needed new paradigm and new world economic order. Whether that new system will be driven by Pharmaceutical cartels, and sociopathic bankers running global health policy for a technocratic elite of social engineers or whether it will be driven by nation states shaping the terms of that new system around human needs, remains to be seen.
If nation states manage to stay in the driver’s seat of this new system, then it will have to be driven by certain fundamental principles of healthcare for all, science practice reform and broader political/economic reform whereby the sacredness of human life is placed above all considerations of monetary profit. In this light, such crash programs into long term projects in space science, asteroid defense, and Lunar/Mars development will be as necessary in the astrophysical domain as crash programs in fusion energy will be in the atomic domain. Uniting both worlds, is the domain of life sciences that intersects the electromagnetic properties of atoms, cells and DNA with the large scale electromagnetic properties of the Earth, Sun and galaxy as a whole.",0
"Presently, billions of people around the world are ‘living’ under mandatory stay-at-home orders, purportedly to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Aside from the question as to whether quarantine is the most effective method for fighting this particular pandemic, what exactly will be required from us before any semblance of normalcy returns?One possible requirement – aside from being discouraged from ever shaking hands again – is the mandatory participation in a global vaccine program, underwritten by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Pharma and an assortment of other people who supposedly have the best interest of the global citizenry in mind. Should we be concerned? The road to mandatory vaccinations. Last week, during an interview with The Journal podcast, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has become the face of the Trump Administration’s Coronavirus Task Force, said something that should have made a lot of people sit up and take notice, especially those people whose job it is to sit up and take notice, namely the media.
Kate Linebaugh asked Fauci if it were advisable that she give her grandmother, who has “vulnerable respiratory systems,” a hug at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, to which Fauci replied in the negative before uttering something revealing.“When [the coronavirus rate of infection] goes down, and gets down to almost zero… there is an antibody test that will be widely distributed pretty soon, in the next few weeks, that will allow you to know whether or not you’ve actually been infected.”He added: “I can imagine a situation where you take an antibody test and you are absolutely positive that you were infected and you did well, then you could hug the heck out of your grandmother and not worry about it.”Let that comment sink in for a moment.If it is deemed safe for those antibodies-positive people to “hug the heck” out their grandmas after proving their immunity credentials, then why on earth is it also not permissible for these same people to be at their jobs, places of worship, or at least the corner pub enjoying some semblance of happy hour?To repeat: if you have already been exposed to the coronavirus and now have natural immunity to the disease (it is estimated that over 80% of people become exposed to the disease without ever knowing it), then you are no longer a risk factor to the most vulnerable members of society, namely the sick and elderly. Thus, by practicing a severe form of “social distancing,” as many countries around the world are now mandating, the ability of the human body to acquire the antibodies, which eventually leads to ‘herd immunity’ in the overall population, is being denied.Allowing ‘herd immunity’ to occur would have prevented: 1. the virus from mutating into a far more vicious beast of burden due to lack of available hosts, 2. the lengthy life span of the virus; although the curve may flatten earlier, without herd immunity the disease may easily return, and worse the second time, and 3. a wide-scale vaccination program down the road.Fauci went on to say that only after the infection rate “gets down to almost zero” antibody tests will be given to determine who has been infected and who hasn’t. But isn’t that putting the proverbial cart before the horse? The tests should have been given in the beginning when the outbreak made landfall. Instead, we are faced with a situation where millions of people who no longer pose a risk either to themselves and others are now in a senseless lockdown that threatens to destabilize the global economy with another Great Depression – and with potentially higher mortality rates than we are witnessing with the coronavirus.
A case for following the herd.With global hysteria over the coronavirus intensifying, a number of experts have come out to question the logic of entire nations battening down the hatches against the coronavirus. One of those individuals is Dr. Knut M. Wittkowski, head of the Department of Biostatistics Epidemiology at Rockefeller University.
“As with every respiratory disease, we should protect the elderly and the fragile,” Dr. Wittkowski acknowledged with common sense available to anyone. He then challenged the actions being taken to shield children from the disease. “On the other hand, children do very well with these diseases and are evolutionarily designed to be exposed to all sorts of viruses.”When people are allowed to go about their daily lives in a community setting, he argued, the elderly could eventually – sooner rather than later – come into contact with the rest of the population in “about four weeks” because the virus at this point would be “vanquished.”“With all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is ‘herd immunity,’” Wittkowski emphasized.In addition to questioning the shortcomings of social distancing protocols, there is also the problem of knowing how many people in the population have already been exposed to the virus as compared to the number who have died. This is known in the medical community as the ‘Measured Case Fatality Rate,’ which is simply the total number of new deaths due to disease divided by the total number of patients with disease. Although it is a simple mathematical equation to perform, it has never been measured due to lack of data.Since no official study has been done to know how many people in the population have already had the disease, it is impossible to determine the lethality of the coronavirus. Thus, the idea of shutting down a wide swath of the economy over a death rate that we do not know could be best described as – in the words of Jay Bhattacharya, MD, PhD, who is both a Professor of Medicine at Stanford University, as well as a Senior Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research – “astounding.”“People plug the worst-case into their models, they project say 2-4 million deaths, newspapers pick up the 2-4 million deaths, politicians have to respond, and the scientific basis for that projection…is non-existent,” Bhattacharya said in an interview with the Hoover Institution.Despite so much uncertainty with regards to the real mortality rate, US medical spokespersons are uttering incredibly irresponsible statements that only serve to instill a sense of fear throughout society. Dr. Fauci, for example, said in the course of his above interview that “I don’t think we should ever shake hands ever again, to be honest with you.” Meanwhile, World Health Organization (WHO) special envoy David Nabarro told the BBC that “some form of facial protection, I’m sure, is going to become the norm.”Now, judging how the medical experts are preventing entire nations from acquiring herd immunity, together with the media’s refusal to consider the merits of hydroxychloroquine, this leads to what should have been the last resort: a vaccine program, which could very well turn out to be mandatory; a requirement forced on individuals before they are able to participate in any sort of public events again.This much was suggested by none other than the world’s premier vaccine pusher, Bill Gates, who said in a recent interview that any sort of mass gatherings “may not come back at all” without a wide-scale vaccination program. Some would call that a form of blackmail, used against a desperate people who would do just about anything right now to get back to life as they once knew it. Those days appear far in the future. Just this week, the UK announced that people will have to “live with some restrictions” until a vaccine is developed.To be clear, few people would question that vaccines have been an inherent good for civilization; they have helped eradicate some of the worst diseases mankind has ever faced, like smallpox and polio. But today things are not so straightforward as simply eradicating a pandemic. Presently, there is a major push being made – with Bill Gates at the vanguard of those efforts – to introduce a vaccine that contains nanotechnology to ‘mark’ and surveil those injected. As just one example, consider the work being carried out by ID2020, a San Francisco-based biometric company that counts Microsoft as one of its founding members. It recently announced it was exploring “identification technologies for infants” that is based on “infant immunization.” In other words, tracking devices embedded inside of vaccines.While the world would welcome a vaccine that eradicates the coronavirus, many would find it unacceptable to be forced to have a vaccine that contains any sort of surveillance technology. At this point in our battle against a pandemic, which has created millions of newly unemployed, the last thing people need in their lives right now is yet another source of worry. Let’s develop a vaccine against coronavirus, Mr. Gates, but please hold the tracking add-ons.",0
"With every tragedy that befalls mankind few political leaders can resist the temptation to enhance the powers of the security state while attacking civil liberties. The response to the coronavirus pandemic has proven to be no exception.Many people are asking, as the Covid lockdown keeps many businesses shuttered: will the economy ever be the same again? No small consideration considering the arbitrary nature of the lockdown, which seems to focus its wrath on small businesses while allowing the major corporations to survive. But there are other serious considerations, like how the media and politicians will hide behind political correctness and virtue signaling to conceal their ulterior motives.
One story that nicely encapsulates that agenda is by the BBC, which carried the totally objective headline: ‘Coronavirus: Arrests over ‘disgusting’ racist Covid-19 stickers.’ It is a very simple story that speaks volumes about where we are heading as a civilization. Plot spoiler: to hell in a handbag.The brief article tells the story of two young men, identities unknown, who were arrested for applying stickers in public places. But not just any old stickers. These ones carried the phrases, ‘Open border, virus disorder,’ and ‘Pubs closed, borders open.’ The accused, however, said to be connected to a “far-right” group, were not charged with the relatively minor offense of defacing public property, but rather on “suspicion of racially aggravated public order offences,” whatever those may happen to be.The message is clear: any suggestion that open borders may not be the best idea, even at the peak of a global pandemic, is the wild ranting of a foaming-at-the-mouth xenophobe, as opposed to maybe just a germophobe, and should be immediately vilified and rejected out of hand. In other words, yet more identity politics, enshrined in Cultural Marxist ideology, sets the agenda.Indeed, the severe brevity of the article made it look more like a cheap communist propaganda poster than any work of journalism. The reader is treated to a quote from one Alex Gwynne, who seems to be resident, but that is never disclosed: “Using this pandemic to spread racism and hatred is unacceptable.” Thank you, Alex.Next up is Ben Miskell, a local councilor, who is quoted as saying: “These sorts of things are meant to just divide us … and capitalise on something awful that is happening in Britain for some really sinister aim.”Like perhaps containing the spread of a pandemic that has forced the lockdown of businesses and communities around the world? As to be expected, the article never once attempted to provide some insight into the deep fear and frustration that is gnawing away at so many people in Britain, and elsewhere, as families fear for an uncertain future. While the media obsesses over the coronavirus, the British are forced to watch as thousands of new arrivals enter their country each month. Yet not a peep from the media as to the logic behind such programs amid a pandemic. It is those sorts of deceitful liberal tactics, which discard real concerns over open borders as racist and chauvinistic that will help bring the lockdown pot to a boil.
Meanwhile, with borders in the Western becoming practically a synonym for racism, the authorities have taken to the skies to make sure the local herd is complying with social-distancing measures. And reportedly with the assistance of China. All in the name of “protecting lives,” of course.Chinese company Da Jiang Innovations, the world’s largest drone manufacturer, has donated their aerial vehicles to law enforcement agencies in 22 U.S. states in their effort to regulate social distancing rules. Yet, in 2017, the Department of Homeland Security warned that DJI was “selectively targeting government and privately owned entities…to expand its ability to collect and exploit sensitive U.S. data.” This led to the Department of the Interior grounding its fleet of some 800 DJI drones over security fears. Yet when it comes to monitoring Americans, in both public and private settings, not even the sky is the limit.“If these drones save one life, it is clearly worth the activity and the information that the drones are sending,” Chris Bollwage, mayor of Elizabeth, N.J. told MSNBC.Perhaps the operators of those drones have a working relationship with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who revealed his true colors when he told New Yorkers to squeal on family and friends who break the social-distancing order.“Sending that photo in is going to help make sure that people are kept apart, and that’s going to stop the disease from spreading. And that’s going to save lives,” he said.As proof that humanity has not gone completely to the dogs, the special hotline to accept the photographs was flooded with derogatory pictures and Hitler memes, most of which are too indecent to show, here.Even political protests are no longer happening in a ‘civilized’ manner, at least in Israel, where a demonstration against Benjamin Netanyahu saw participants respecting the 2-meters-apart rule, which made the ‘protest’ resemble some sort of open-air modern art exhibit as opposed to a challenge to the powers-that-be. By necessity, a protest demands that the participants act as a single united force, a throng, if you will.Want to say a pray in a house of worship asking the Almighty to see you through this miserable storm, which appears to have only just begun? Well, that too will prove problematic since in many U.S. states worshipers are no longer permitted to congregate under a single roof, which is strange because liquor stores, gun shops and abortion clinics, not to mention all of the major grocery stores are doing a thriving business despite the inherent risks.What is happening is obvious. Leaders, either by design or otherwise, are taking advantage of the current emergency to ram through draconian measures in the name of “protecting the people.” In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. And with the Western world already softened up with years of political correctness, virtue signaling and the tyrannical nanny state, virile ‘toxic masculinity’ has gone missing in action when it is needed the most. The coronavirus is not the disease that is killing Western civilization; social-distancing and lockdown measures should have been enforced many decades ago when the Cultural Marxists from the Frankfurt School first set foot ashore. That was the moment Western society, set upon itself by a number of divisive and destructive movements, began to crumble to the point when the next flu season may very well consign it to the ash heap of history.",0
"A recurring theme among conspiracy theorists is that the elite are just waiting for the right moment to roll out their ‘mark of the beast’ technology to remotely identify and control every single human being on the planet, thus sealing their plans for a one world government. And with many people willing to do just about anything to get back to some sense of normalcy, those fears appear more justified with each passing day.In the Book of Revelation [13:16-17], there is a passage that has attracted the imagination of believers and disbelievers throughout the ages, and perhaps never more so than right now: “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark…”Was John of Patmos history’s first conspiracy theorist, or are we merely indulging ourselves today with a case of self-fulfilling prophecy? Whatever the case may be, many people would probably have serious reservations about being branded with an ID code even if it had never been mentioned in Holy Scripture. But that certainly has not stopped Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who has been warning about a global pandemic for years, from pushing such controversial technologies on all of us.In September 2019, just three months before the coronavirus first appeared in China, ID2020, a San Francisco-based biometric company that counts Microsoft as one of its founding members, quietly announced it was undertaking a new project that involves the “exploration of multiple biometric identification technologies for infants” that is based on “infant immunization” and only uses the “most successful approaches”.For anyone who may be wondering what one of those “most successful approaches” might look like, consider the following top contender for the contract. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed what is essentially a hi-tech ‘tattoo’ that stores data in invisible dye under the skin. The ‘mark’ would be delivered together with a vaccine, most likely administered by Gavi, the global vaccine agency that also falls under the umbrella of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.“The researchers showed that their new dye, which consists of nanocrystals called quantum dots… emits near-infrared light that can be detected by a specially equipped smartphone,” MIT News reported.And if the reader scrolls to the very bottom of the article, he will find that this study was funded first and foremost by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Today, with the global service economy shut down to prevent large groups of infectious humans from assembling, it is easier to imagine a day when people are required to have their infrared ID ‘tattoo’ scanned in order to be granted access to any number of public venues. And from there, it requires little stretch of the imagination to see this same tracking nanotechnology being applied broadly across the global economy, where it could be used to eliminate the use of dirty money. After all, if reusable bags are being outlawed over the coronavirus panic-demic, why should reusable cash get special treatment?Writing earlier this month in these pages, geopolitical analyst Pepe Escobar provided a compelling argument that the coronavirus, which is driving the world towards a New Great Depression, is “being used as cover for the advent of a new, digital financial system, complete with a forced vaccine cum nanochip creating a full, individual, digital identity.As one possible future scenario, Escobar imagined “clusters of smart cities linked by AI, with people monitored full time and duly micro-chipped doing what they need with a unified digital currency.Those fears took on greater significance when Bill Gates sat down over the weekend for a breathtaking interview with CBS This Morning. Gates told host Anthony Mason that mass gatherings might have to be prohibited in the age of coronavirus unless and until a wide scale vaccination program is enacted.
“What does ‘opening up’ look like,” Gates asked rhetorically before essentially changing the entire social and cultural makeup of the United States in one fell swoop. “Which activities, like schools, have such benefit and can be done in a way that the risk of transmission is very low, and which activities, like mass gatherings, maybe, in a certain sense more optional. And so until you’re widely vaccinated those [activities] may not come back at all” [The interview can be watched in its entirety here.According to Gates, anything that could be defined as a “mass gathering” – from spectators packed into a stadium for a sporting event, to protesters out on the street in demonstration – would be considered an act of civil disobedience without a vaccine. Little surprise that Gates chose the concept of “mass gathering” to snag all of us, for what is modern democratic society if not one big mass event after another? Indeed, since nobody will want to miss the next big happening, like the Super Bowl, or Comic-Con, or, heaven forbid, Eurovision, millions of people would predictably line up for miles to get their Microsoft-supported inoculation, even if it contains tracking technologies.All of this seems like sheer madness when it is remembered that there are other options for defeating the coronavirus than a mandatory global vaccine regime.Just last month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director, told a Senate Subcommittee that over 80 percent of the people who get infected by the coronavirus “spontaneously recover” without any medical intervention. This makes one wonder why the global lockdown was designed for everyone instead of just the sick and elderly. Meanwhile, the drug hydroxychloroquine, which has been downplayed in the media despite being named as the most effective coronavirus treatment among physicians in a major survey, is starting to get a fresh look.Just this week, following Nevada’s lead, Michigan just reversed course and is now the second democratic state to request the anti-malarial drug from the Trump administration.So now it looks as though we are off to the races to see what will become the approved method of fighting the global pandemic – a hastily developed vaccine that may actually worsen the effects of the disease in those who contract it, or the already proven inexpensive drug hydroxychloroquine.
If the winner turns out to be a global vaccine, possibly one that carries ID nanotechnology, don’t expect the wealthy to be lining up with their kids to be the first to get it. In 2015, The American Journal of Public Heath surveyed some 6,200 schools in California – the epicenter of biometric ID research – and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners enrolled in private institutions.
It seems that the elite are betting heavily on the development of an ID-tracking vaccine that would bring all races and institutions together under one big happy roof, but clearly they will continue living in their own fenced-off neighborhood in this one world government. Whether or not they will get a ‘special pass’ from receiving the new-age mark is another question.",0
"The most commonly reported mainstream media account of the creation of the Coronavirus suggests that it was derived from an animal borne microorganism found in a wild bat that was consumed by an ethnic Chinese resident of Wuhan. But there appears to be some evidence to dispute that in that adjacent provinces in China, where wild bats are more numerous, have not experienced major outbreaks of the disease. Because of that and other factors, there has also been considerable speculation that the Coronavirus did not occur naturally through mutation but rather was produced in a laboratory, possibly as a biological warfare agent.Several reports suggest that there are components of the virus that are related to HIV that could not have occurred naturally. If it is correct that the virus had either been developed or even produced to be weaponized it would further suggest that its escape from the Wuhan Institute of Virology Lab and into the animal and human population could have been accidental. Technicians who work in such environments are aware that “leaks” from laboratories occur frequently.
There is, of course and inevitably, another theory. There has been some speculation that as the Trump Administration has been constantly raising the issue of growing Chinese global competitiveness as a direct threat to American national security and economic dominance, it must might be possible that Washington has created and unleashed the virus in a bid to bring Beijing’s growing economy and military might down a few notches. It is, to be sure, hard to believe that even the Trump White House would do something so reckless, but there are precedents for that type of behavior. In 2005-9 the American and Israeli governments secretly developed a computer virus called Stuxnet, which was intended to damage the control and operating systems of Iranian computers being used in that country’s nuclear research program. Admittedly Stuxnet was intended to damage computers, not to infect or kill human beings, but concerns that it would propagate and move to infect computers outside Iran proved to be accurate as it spread to thousands of PCs outside Iran, in countries as far flung as China, Germany, Kazakhstan and Indonesia.Inevitably there is an Israeli story that just might shed some light on what has been going on in China. Scientists at Israel’s Galilee Research Institute are now claiming that they will have a vaccine against coronavirus in a few weeks which will be ready for distribution and use within 90 days. The institute is claiming that it has been engaged in four years of research on avian coronavirus funded by Israel’s Ministries of Science & Technology and Agriculture. They are claiming that the virus is similar to the version that has infected humans, which has led to breakthroughs in development through genetic manipulation, but some scientists are skeptical that a new vaccine could be produced so quickly to prevent a virus that existed only recently. They also have warned that even if a vaccine is developed it would normally have to be tested for side effects, a process that normally takes over a year and includes using it on infected humans.If one even considers it possible that the United States had a hand in creating the coronavirus at what remains of its once extensive biological weapons research center in Ft Detrick Maryland, it is very likely that Israel was a partner in the project. Helping to develop the virus would also explain how Israeli scientists have been able to claim success at creating a vaccine so quickly, possibly because the virus and a treatment for it were developed simultaneously.In any event, there are definite political ramifications to the appearance of the coronavirus, and not only in China. In the United States President Donald Trump is already being blamed for lying about the virus and there are various scenarios in mainstream publications speculating over the possible impact on the election in 2020. If the economy sinks together with the stock market, it will reflect badly on Trump whether or not he is actually at fault. If containment and treatment of the disease itself in the United States does not go well, there could also be a considerable backlash, particularly as the Democrats have been promoting improving health care. One pundit argues, however, that disease and a sinking economy will not matter as long as there is a turnaround before the election, but a lot can happen in the next eight months.And then there is the national security/foreign policy issue as seen from both Jerusalem and Washington. It is difficult to explain why coronavirus has hit one country in particular other than China very severely. That country is Iran, the often-cited enemy of both the U.S. and Israel. The number of Iran’s coronavirus cases continues to increase, with more positive tests confirmed among government officials last Saturday. There were 205 new coronavirus cases, bringing the government claimed total to 593 with 43 fatalities, though unofficial hospital reports suggest that the deaths are actually well over 100. That’s the highest number of deaths from the virus outside of China.No less than five Iranian Members of Parliament have also tested positive amid a growing number of officials that have contracted the disease. Iran’s vice president Masoumeh Ebtekar and deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi had also previously been confirmed with the virus.The usual suspects in the United States are delighted to learn of the Iranian deaths. Mark Dubowitz, Executive Director of the Washington-based but Israeli government connected Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) boasted on twitter Tuesday that “Coronavirus has done what American economic sanctions could not: shut down non-oil exports.” An Iranian government spokesman responded that “It’s shameful and downright inhuman to cheer for a deadly Virus to spread – and enjoy seeing people suffer for it…” Dubowitz followed up with an additional taunt, that Tehran has “spread terrorism” in the Middle East and “now it’s spreading the coronavirus.”So, you have your choice. Coronavirus occurred naturally, or it came out of a lab in China itself or even from Israel or the United States. If one suspects Israel and/or the United States, the intent clearly would have been to create a biological weapon that would damage two nations that have been designated as enemies. But the coronavirus cannot be contained easily and it is clear that many thousands of people will die from it. Unfortunately, as with Stuxnet, once the genie is out of the bottled it is devilishly hard to induce it to go back in.",0
"The New Silk Roads – or Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – were launched by President Xi Jinping in 2013, first in Central Asia (Nur-Sultan) and then Southeast Asia (Jakarta).One year later, the Chinese economy overtook the U.S. on a PPP basis. Inexorably, year after year since the start of the millennium, the U.S. share of the global economy shrinks while China’s increases.China is already the key hub of the global economy and the leading trade partner of nearly 130 nations.While the U.S. economy is hollowed out, and the casino financing of the U.S. government – repo markets and all – reads as a dystopian nightmare, the civilization-state steps ahead in myriad areas of technological research, not least because of Made in China 2025.China largely beats the U.S. on patent filings and produces at least 8 times as many STEM graduates a year than the U.S., earning the status of top contributor to global science.A vast array of nations across the Global South signed on to be part of BRI, which is planned for completion in 2049. Last year alone, Chinese companies signed contracts worth up to $128 billion in large-scale infrastructure projects in dozen of nations.The only economic competitor to the U.S. is busy reconnecting most of the world to a 21st century, fully networked version of a trade system that was at its peak for over a millennia: the Eurasian Silk Roads.Inevitably this state of things is something interlocking sectors of the U.S. ruling class simply would not accept.Branding BRI as a “pandemic”.As the usual suspects fret over the “stability” of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Xi Jinping administration, the fact is the Beijing leadership has had to deal with an accumulation of extremely severe issues: a swine-flu epidemic killing half the stock; the Trump-concocted trade war; Huawei accused of racketeering and about to be prevented from buying U.S. made chips; bird flu; coronavirus virtually shutting down half of China.Add to it the incessant United States government Hybrid War propaganda barrage, trespassed by acute Sinophobia; everyone from sociopathic “officials” to self-titled councilors are either advising corporate businesses to divert global supply chains out of China or concocting outright calls for regime change – with every possible demonization in between.There are no holds barred in the all-out offensive to kick the Chinese government while it’s down.A Pentagon cipher at the Munich Security Conference once again declares China as the greatest threat, economically and militarily, to the U.S. – and by extension the West, forcing a wobbly EU already subordinated to NATO to be subservient to Washington on this remixed Cold War 2.0.The whole U.S. corporate media complex repeats to exhaustion that Beijing is “lying” and losing control. Descending to sub-gutter, racist levels, hacks even accuse BRI itself of being a pandemic, with China “impossible to quarantine”.All that is quite rich, to say the least, oozing from lavishly rewarded slaves of an unscrupulous, monopolistic, extractive, destructive, depraved, lawless oligarchy which uses debt offensively to boost their unlimited wealth and power while the lowly U.S. and global masses use debt defensively to barely survive. As Thomas Piketty has conclusively shown, inequality always relies on ideology.We’re deep into a vicious intel war. From the point of view of Chinese intelligence, the current toxic cocktail simply cannot be attributed to just a random series of coincidences. Beijing has serial motives to piece this extraordinary chain of events as part of a coordinated Hybrid War, Full Spectrum Dominance attack on China.
Enter the Dragon Killer working hypothesis: a bio-weapon attack capable of causing immense economic damage but protected by plausible deniability. The only possible move by the “indispensable nation” on the New Great Game chessboard, considering that the U.S. cannot win a conventional war on China, and cannot win a nuclear war on China.A biological warfare weapon?On the surface, coronavirus is a dream bio-weapon for those fixated on wreaking havoc across China and praying for regime change.Yet it’s complicated. This report is a decent effort trying to track the origins of coronavirus. Now compare it with the insights by Dr. Francis Boyle, international law professor at the University of Illinois and author, among others, of Biowarfare and Terrorism. He’s the man who drafted the U.S. Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 signed into law by George H. W. Bush.Dr. Boyle is convinced coronavirus is an “offensive biological warfare weapon” that leaped out of the Wuhan BSL-4 laboratory, although he’s “not saying it was done deliberately.”Dr. Boyle adds, “all these BSL-4 labs by United States, Europe, Russia, China, Israel are all there to research, develop, test biological warfare agents. There’s really no legitimate scientific reason to have BSL-4 labs.” His own research led to a whopping $100 billion, by 2015, spent by the United States government on bio-warfare research: “We have well over 13,000 alleged life science scientists… testing biological weapons here in the United States. Actually this goes back and it even precedes 9/11.”Dr. Boyle directly accuses “the Chinese government under Xi and his comrades” of a cover up “from the get-go. The first reported case was December 1, so they’d been sitting on this until they couldn’t anymore. And everything they’re telling you is a lie. It’s propaganda.”The World Health Organization (WHO), for Dr. Boyle, is also on it: “They’ve approved many of these BSL-4 labs (…) Can’t trust anything the WHO says because they’re all bought and paid for by Big Pharma and they work in cahoots with the CDC, which is the United States government, they work in cahoots with Fort Detrick.” Fort Detrick, now a cutting-edge bio-warfare lab, previously was a notorious CIA den of mind control “experiments”.Relying on decades of research in bio-warfare, the U.S. Deep State is totally familiar with all bio-weapon overtones. From Dresden, Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Korea, Vietnam and Fallujah, the historical record shows the United States government does not blink when it comes to unleashing weapons of mass destruction on innocent civilians.For its part, the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) has spent a fortune researching bats, coronaviruses and gene-editing bio-weapons. Now, conveniently – as if this was a form of divine intervention – DARPA’s “strategic allies” have been chosen to develop a genetic vaccine.
The 1996 neocon Bible, the Project for a New American Century (PNAC), unambiguously stated, “advanced forms of biological warfare that can “target” specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.”There’s no question coronavirus, so far, has been a Heaven-sent politically useful tool, reaching, with minimum investment, the desired targets of maximized U.S. global power – even if fleetingly, enhanced by a non-stop propaganda offensive – and China relatively isolated with its economy semi paralyzed.Yet perspective is in order. The CDC estimated that up to 42.9 million people got sick during the 2018-2019 flu season in the U.S. No less than 647,000 people were hospitalized. And 61,200 died.This report details the Chinese “people’s war” against coronavirus.It’s up to Chinese virologists to decode its arguably synthetic origin. How China reacts, depending on the findings, will have earth-shattering consequences – literally.Setting the stage for the Raging Twenties.After managing to reroute trade supply chains across Eurasia to its own advantage and hollow out the Heartland, American – and subordinated Western – elites are now staring into a void. And the void is staring back. A “West” ruled by the U.S. is now faced with irrelevance. BRI is in the process of reversing at least two centuries of Western dominance.There’s no way the West and especially the “system leader” U.S. will allow it. It all started with dirty ops stirring trouble across the periphery of Eurasia – from Ukraine to Syria to Myanmar.Now it’s when the going really gets tough. The targeted assassination of Maj. Gen. Soleimani plus coronavirus – the Wuhan flu – have really set up the stage for the Raging Twenties. The designation of choice should actually be WARS – Wuhan Acute Respiratory Syndrome. That would instantly give the game away as a War against Humanity – irrespective of where it came from.",0
"The coronavirus has saturated news, social media and conversations around the world for the past few weeks. And people understandably have questions such as; masks to wear or not to wear? Or, will the flu shot protect you from coronavirus? No. Is the coronavirus anything to do with Corona beer? No, come on. But with so much focus on the topic and new information about the outbreak coming out constantly, inevitably a slew of spurious information is also flooding the internet and coronavirus has resulted in several, well...viral news stories with little scientific merit.The newest of these was a little unusual because it was based on a pre-print of a real scientific paper, (since removed just a few hours ago) uploaded to website bioRxiv, where scientists can present their completed, or near-completed studies, prior to peer-review by other scientists. The work, by a group based in India, was entitled “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag.”Seeing HIV and coronavirus in the same sentence is understandably a little startling, so what does it actually mean?“Based on analysis of multiple, very short regions of proteins in the novel coronavirus, the bioRxiv paper claimed that the new coronavirus may have acquired these regions from HIV,” said Arinjay Banerjee, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in virology at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada who has extensively studied coronaviruses.Some types of viruses can swap pieces of their genetic code and in this case,the authors of the study say that the specific coronavirus which is involved in the most recent outbreak (2019-nCoV) has four small chunks of sequence in its genetic code which are not found in other, similar coronaviruses like SARS. According to the authors, these pieces bear some resemblance to bits of sequence also found in HIV.However, the authors then speculated that this might not be a coincidence and perhaps the bits of genetic code were put there intentionally. The conspiracy theory was addressed today by a scientist from the Wuhan Institute of Virology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who rubbished the claims.The wider scientific community, upon seeing the paper, were also less than impressed with these conclusions and speculations and swiftly set about not only voicing their concerns, but analyzing the data to double-check the results.Essentially, the scientists found that yes, there are some additions in the nCoV coronavirus originating in Wuhan that other coronaviruses don’t have, which are similar to pieces of sequence found in HIV. But, the kicker here is that these pieces of genetic code are also found in countless other viruses and there’s no reason to believe they specifically came from HIV, at all.“The authors compared very short regions of proteins in the novel coronavirus and concluded that the small segments of proteins were similar to segments in HIV proteins. Comparing very short segments can often generate 0 positives and it is difficult to make these conclusions using small protein segments,” said Banerjee.The paper was withdrawn from bioRxiv on Sunday afternoon with one of the authors stating: “ it was not our intention to feed into the conspiracy theories and no such claims are made here.” The author further declares that the researchers will revise the paper and re-analyze the data before submitting it again.But despite the removal, the pre-print paper has stimulated a heap of discussion about HIV and coronavirus. Many people have asked on social media why, if coronavirus does not have pieces of HIV in it, HIV drugs are being used in some cases to treat the virus, with preliminary evidence that they, and other anti-viral drugs appear to be working in some cases.“Some antiviral drugs can work against fundamental and generic steps involved in RNA virus replication. Anti-HIV drugs that inhibit viral RNA (genome) replication or the process of making viral protein from viral RNA may also work against other RNA viruses. This depends on the mode of action of the drugs,” explains Banerjee.Presumably in response to the rather critical attention that this paper received, bioRxiv has added a banner ‘warning’ to every new preprint on the website:“bioRxiv is receiving many new papers on coronavirus 2019-nCoV. A reminder: these are preliminary reports that have not been peer-reviewed. They should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or be reported in news media as established information,” read the statement.Publishing scientific articles as pre-prints without any peer review beforehand is controversial and complex, with one valid question being whether media outlets should cover pre-print work and risk potentially misinforming the public if the original results are not quite up to scratch, as happened with the recent HIV/coronavirus paper. Has this recent incident tarnished the reputation of preprints?“No. In fact, I believe that this is why pre-prints were established. The scientific community can provide feedback prior to formal peer-review. Pre-prints offer the authors an opportunity to seek feedback from a wider scientific community, more than the 2-3 peer-reviewers in a formal review setting,” said Banerjee, stating that this paper certainly would not have passed official peer review.“It is unfortunate that multiple articles on pre-print servers were victims of viral social media posts, especially studies that were not robust or scientifically sound,” said Banerjee. “But I am impressed how quickly other researchers debunked the studies and reanalyzed the data,” he added.",1
"Since the first reports of novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei province, China1,2, there has been considerable discussion on the origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-23 (also referred to as HCoV-19)4. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 are now widespread, and as of 11 March 2020, 121,564 cases have been confirmed in more than 110 countries, with 4,373 deaths5.SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans; SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe disease, whereas HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E are associated with mild symptoms6. Here we review what can be deduced about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from comparative analysis of genomic data. We offer a perspective on the notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which they could have arisen. Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.Notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.Our comparison of alpha- and betacoronaviruses identifies two notable genomic features of SARS-CoV-2: (i) on the basis of structural studies7,8,9 and biochemical experiments1,9,10, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human receptor ACE2; and (ii) the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a functional polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1–S2 boundary through the insertion of 12 nucleotides8, which additionally led to the predicted acquisition of three O-linked glycans around the site.Mutations in the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2.The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein is the most variable part of the coronavirus genome1,2. Six RBD amino acids have been shown to be critical for binding to ACE2 receptors and for determining the host range of SARS-CoV-like viruses7. With coordinates based on SARS-CoV, they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487 and Y4911, which correspond to L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501 and Y505 in SARS-CoV-27. Five of these six residues differ between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 1a). On the basis of structural studies7,8,9 and biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that binds with high affinity to ACE2 from humans, ferrets, cats and other species with high receptor homology7.While the analyses above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2 with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the interaction is not ideal7 and that the RBD sequence is different from those shown in SARS-CoV to be optimal for receptor binding. Thus, the high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection on a human or human-like ACE2 that permits another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not the product of purposeful manipulation.Polybasic furin cleavage site and O-linked glycans.The second notable feature of SARS-CoV-2 is a polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) at the junction of S1 and S2, the two subunits of the spike8 (Fig. 1b). This allows effective cleavage by furin and other proteases and has a role in determining viral infectivity and host range. In addition, a leading proline is also inserted at this site in SARS-CoV-2; thus, the inserted sequence is PRRA. The turn created by the proline is predicted to result in the addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678 and S686, which flank the cleavage site and are unique to SARS-CoV-2. Polybasic cleavage sites have not been observed in related ‘lineage B’ betacoronaviruses, although other human betacoronaviruses, including HKU1 (lineage A), have those sites and predicted O-linked glycans13. Given the level of genetic variation in the spike, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2-like viruses with partial or full polybasic cleavage sites will be discovered in other species.
The functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, and it will be important to determine its impact on transmissibility and pathogenesis in animal models. Experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that insertion of a furin cleavage site at the S1–S2 junction enhances cell–cell fusion without affecting viral entry. In addition, efficient cleavage of the MERS-CoV spike enables MERS-like coronaviruses from bats to infect human cells. In avian influenza viruses, rapid replication and transmission in highly dense chicken populations selects for the acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein16, which serves a function similar to that of the coronavirus spike protein. Acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites in HA, by insertion or recombination, converts low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic forms16. The acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites by HA has also been observed after repeated passage in cell culture or through animals.The function of the predicted O-linked glycans is unclear, but they could create a ‘mucin-like domain’ that shields epitopes or key residues on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Several viruses utilize mucin-like domains as glycan shields involved immunoevasion18. Although prediction of O-linked glycosylation is robust, experimental studies are needed to determine if these sites are used in SARS-CoV-2.Theories of SARS-CoV-2 origins.It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted7,11. Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used19. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone20. Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer; and natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. We also discuss whether selection during passage could have given rise to SARS-CoV-2.Natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer. As many early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan market in Wuhan1,2, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses2, it is likely that bats serve as reservoir hosts for its progenitor. Although RaTG13, sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis bat1, is ~96% identical overall to SARS-CoV-2, its spike diverges in the RBD, which suggests that it may not bind efficiently to human ACE27 (Fig. 1a).Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2. Although the RaTG bat virus remains the closest to SARS-CoV-2 across the genome1, some pangolin coronaviruses exhibit strong similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, including all six key RBD residues. This clearly shows that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein optimized for binding to human-like ACE2 is the result of natural selection.Neither the bat betacoronaviruses nor the pangolin betacoronaviruses sampled thus far have polybasic cleavage sites. Although no animal coronavirus has been identified that is sufficiently similar to have served as the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV-2, the diversity of coronaviruses in bats and other species is massively undersampled. Mutations, insertions and deletions can occur near the S1–S2 junction of coronaviruses22, which shows that the polybasic cleavage site can arise by a natural evolutionary process. For a precursor virus to acquire both the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for binding to human ACE2, an animal host would probably have to have a high population density (to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently) and an ACE2-encoding gene that is similar to the human ortholog. Natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.It is possible that a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 jumped into humans, acquiring the genomic features described above through adaptation during undetected human-to-human transmission. Once acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it.All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the genomic features described above and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had them too. The presence in pangolins of an RBD very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 means that we can infer this was also probably in the virus that jumped to humans. This leaves the insertion of polybasic cleavage site to occur during human-to-human transmission.Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 made with current sequence data point to emergence of the virus in late November 2019 to early December 201923, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases24. Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognized transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site. Sufficient opportunity could have arisen if there had been many prior zoonotic events that produced short chains of human-to-human transmission over an extended period. This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV, for which all human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short transmission chains that eventually resolve, with no adaptation to sustained transmission25.Studies of banked human samples could provide information on whether such cryptic spread has occurred. Retrospective serological studies could also be informative, and a few such studies have been conducted showing low-level exposures to SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses in certain areas of China26. Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether exposures were due to prior infections with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or other SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses. Further serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Selection during passage.Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models has been ongoing for many years in biosafety level 2 laboratories across the world27, and there are documented instances of laboratory escapes of SARS-CoV28. We must therefore examine the possibility of an inadvertent laboratory release of SARS-CoV-2.In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired RBD mutations (Fig. 1a) during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies of SARS-CoV11. The finding of SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses from pangolins with nearly identical RBDs, however, provides a much stronger and more parsimonious explanation of how SARS-CoV-2 acquired these via recombination or mutation19.The acquisition of both the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans also argues against culture-based scenarios. New polybasic cleavage sites have been observed only after prolonged passage of low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus in vitro or in vivo17. Furthermore, a hypothetical generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with very high genetic similarity, which has not been described. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required repeated passage in cell culture or animals with ACE2 receptors similar to those of humans, but such work has also not previously been described. Finally, the generation of the predicted O-linked glycans is also unlikely to have occurred due to cell-culture passage, as such features suggest the involvement of an immune system18.Conclusions.In the midst of the global COVID-19 public-health emergency, it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the pandemic matter. Detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species, then there is the risk of future re-emergence events. In contrast, if the adaptive process occurred in humans, then even if repeated zoonotic transfers occur, they are unlikely to take off without the same series of mutations. In addition, identifying the closest viral relatives of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in animals will greatly assist studies of viral function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence helped reveal key RBD mutations and the polybasic cleavage site.The genomic features described here may explain in part the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although the evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here. However, since we observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features, including the optimized RBD and polybasic cleavage site, in related coronaviruses in nature, we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.More scientific data could swing the balance of evidence to favor one hypothesis over another. Obtaining related viral sequences from animal sources would be the most definitive way of revealing viral origins. For example, a future observation of an intermediate or fully formed polybasic cleavage site in a SARS-CoV-2-like virus from animals would lend even further support to the natural-selection hypotheses. It would also be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about SARS-CoV-2, including animal studies. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as sequencing of the virus from very early cases, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of the exact mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 originated via natural selection, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.",1
"At an emergency meeting in Beijing held last Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke about the need to contain the coronavirus and set up a system to prevent similar epidemics in the future.A national system to control biosecurity risks must be put in place “to protect the people’s health,” Xi said, because lab safety is a “national security” issue.Xi didn’t actually admit that the coronavirus now devastating large swathes of China had escaped from one of the country’s bioresearch labs. But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is exactly what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive entitled: “Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.”
Read that again. It sure sounds like China has a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong, doesn’t it? And just how many “microbiology labs” are there in China that handle “advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus”?It turns out that in all of China there is only one. And this one is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be . . . the epicenter of the epidemic.
That’s right. China’s only Level 4 microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, called the National Biosafety Laboratory, is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.What’s more, the People’s Liberation Army’s top expert in biological warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.According to the PLA Daily, Gen. Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax. This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.
Does that suggest to you that the novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, may have escaped from that very lab, and that Gen. Chen’s job is to try and put the genie back in the bottle, as it were? It does to me.Add to this China’s history of similar incidents. Even the deadly SARS virus has escaped — twice — from the Beijing lab where it was — and probably is — being used in experiments. Both “man-made” epidemics were quickly contained, but neither would have happened at all if proper safety precautions had been taken.
And then there is this little-known fact: Some Chinese researchers are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them.You heard me right.Instead of properly disposing of infected animals by cremation, as the law requires, they sell them on the side to make a little extra cash. Or, in some cases, a lot of extra cash. One Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound up in someone’s stomach.Also fueling suspicions about SARS-CoV-2’s origins is the series of increasingly lame excuses offered by the Chinese authorities as people began to sicken and die.They first blamed a seafood market not far from the Institute of Virology, even though the first documented cases of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) involved people who had never set foot there. Then they pointed to snakes, bats and even a cute little scaly anteater called a pangolin as the source of the virus.
I don’t buy any of this. It turns out that snakes don’t carry coronaviruses and that bats aren’t sold at a seafood market. Neither are pangolins, for that matter, an endangered species valued for their scales as much as for their meat.The evidence points to SARS-CoV-2 research being carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virus may have been carried out of the lab by an infected worker or crossed over into humans when they unknowingly dined on a lab animal. Whatever the vector, Beijing authorities are now clearly scrambling to correct the serious problems with the way their labs handle deadly pathogens.China has unleashed a plague on its own people. It’s too early to say how many in China and other countries will ultimately die for the failures of their country’s state-run microbiology labs, but the human cost will be high.But not to worry. Xi has assured us that he is controlling biosecurity risks “to protect the people’s health.” PLA bioweapons experts are in charge.I doubt the Chinese people will find that very reassuring. Neither should we.",0
"A group of 27 prominent public health scientists from outside China is pushing back against a steady stream of stories and even a scientific paper suggesting a laboratory in Wuhan, China, may be the origin of the outbreak of COVID-19. “The rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins,” the scientists, from nine countries, write in a statement published online by The Lancet yesterday.
The letter does not criticize any specific assertions about the origin of the outbreak, but many posts on social media have singled out the Wuhan Institute of Virology for intense scrutiny because it has a laboratory at the highest security level—biosafety level 4—and its researchers study coronaviruses from bats, including the one that is closest to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Speculations have included the possibility that the virus was bioengineered in the lab or that a lab worker was infected while handling a bat and then transmitted the disease to others outside the lab. Researchers from the institute have insisted there is no link between the outbreak and their laboratory.“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” says The Lancet statement, which praises the work of Chinese health professionals as “remarkable” and encourages others to sign on as well.U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R–AR) added fuel to controversial assertions on Fox News earlier this month when he noted that the lab was “a few miles away” from a seafood market that had a large cluster of some of the first cases detected. “We don’t have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China’s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says,” Cotton said, noting that the Chinese government initially turned down the U.S. government’s offer to send scientists to the country to help clarify questions about the outbreak.The authors of The Lancet statement note that scientists from several countries who have studied SARS-CoV-2 “overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,” just like many other viruses that have recently emerged in humans. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus,” the statement says.Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance and a cosignatory of the statement, has collaborated with researchers at the Wuhan institute who study bat coronaviruses. “We’re in the midst of the social media misinformation age, and these rumors and conspiracy theories have real consequences, including threats of violence that have occurred to our colleagues in China,” Daszak, a disease ecologist, told ScienceInsider. “We have a choice whether to stand up and support colleagues who are being attacked and threatened daily by conspiracy theorists or to just turn a blind eye. I’m really proud that people from nine countries are able to rapidly come to their defense and show solidarity with people who are, after all, dealing with horrific conditions in an outbreak.”",1
"Heads of our entire HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] colluded and destroyed my reputation and the Department of Justice and the [Federal Bureau of Investigation] sat on it, and kept that case under seal.[Fauci] directed the cover-up. And in fact, everybody else was paid off, and paid off big time, millions of dollars in funding from Tony Fauci and … the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. These investigators that committed the fraud, continue to this day to be paid big time by the NIAID.It started really when I was 25 years old, and I was part of the team that isolated HIV from the saliva and blood of the patients from France where [virologist Luc] Montagnier had originally isolated the virus. … Fauci holds up the publication of the paper for several months while Robert Gallo writes his own paper and takes all the credit, and of course patents are involved. This delay of the confirmation, you know, literally led to spreading the virus around, you know, killing millions.And they’ll kill millions, as they already have with their vaccines. There is no vaccine currently on the schedule for any RNA virus that works. Oh, absolutely not. In fact vaccine is immune therapy, just like interferon alpha is immune therapy, so I’m not antivaccine. My job is to develop immune therapies. That’s what vaccines are.I wouldn’t use the word created. But you can’t say naturally occurring if it was by way of the laboratory. So it’s very clear this virus was manipulated. This family of viruses was manipulated and studied in a laboratory where the animals were taken into the laboratory, and this is what was released, whether deliberate or not. That cannot be naturally occurring. Somebody didn’t go to a market, get a bat, the virus didn’t jump directly to humans. That’s not how it works. That’s accelerated viral evolution. If it was a natural occurrence, it would take up to 800 years to occur. Oh yeah, I’m sure it occurred between the North Carolina laboratories, Fort Detrick, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and the Wuhan laboratory.Italy has a very old population. They’re very sick with inflammatory disorders. They got at the beginning of 2019 an untested new form of influenza vaccine that had four different strains of influenza, including the highly pathogenic H1N1. That vaccine was grown in a cell line, a dog cell line. Dogs have lots of coronaviruses.Wearing the mask literally activates your own virus. You’re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions, and if it happens to be SARS-CoV-2, then you’ve got a big problem.Why would you close the beach? You’ve got sequences in the soil, in the sand. You’ve got healing microbes in the ocean in the salt water. That’s insanity.",0
"The hysterical overreaction to the coronavirus has driven our own government to virtually shut down the entire country along with its economy. While we must be diligent to do what we can, by washing our hands, not going to work when we’re sick, and taking special precautions for senior citizens with health problems, there is no need, speaking only for myself, to shut down the entire United States to deal with it. While the search for a vaccine continues, the good news is that a silver bullet may have been found, a cheap generic medication that was developed decades ago (in 1944) to deal with malaria. The drug is Chloroquine phosphate, an old-fashioned anti-malarial drug, which has proven effective against Coronavirus in China and South Korea. Says ABC, “Laboratory studies show chloroquine is effective at preventing as well as treating the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a close cousin of COVID-19.” There are no less than three studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of chloroquine against the coronavirus. One is a study conducted by James M. Todaro and Gregory J. Rigano, in association with Stanford University School of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences Researchers. 
Here’s what the summary of their study says (emphasis mine): Recent guidelines from South Korea and China report that chloroquine is an effective antiviral therapeutic treatment against Coronavirus Disease 2019.  Use of chloroquine (tablets) is showing favorable outcomes in humans infected with Coronavirus including faster time to recovery and shorter hospital stay.  US CDC research shows that chloroquine also has strong potential as a prophylactic (preventative) measure against coronavirus in the lab, while we wait for a vaccine to be developed.  Chloroquine is an inexpensive, globally available drug that has been in widespread human use since 1945 against malaria, autoimmune and various other conditions. The study concludes this way: Chloroquine can both prevent and treat malaria.  Chloroquine can both prevent and treat coronavirus in primate cells.  According to South Korean and China human treatment guidelines, chloroquine is effective in treating COVID-19.  Given chloroquine’s human safety profile and existence, it can be implemented today in the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world.  Medical doctors may be reluctant to prescribe chloroquine to treat COVID-19 since it is not FDA approved for this use.  The United States of America and other countries should immediately authorize and indemnify medical doctors for prescribing chloroquine to treat COVID-19.  We must explore whether chloroquine can safely serve as a preventative measure prior to infection of COVID-19 to stop further spread of this highly contagious virus. 
Chloroquine can be prescribed to adults and children of all ages. It can also be safely taken by pregnant women and nursing mothers. The fact that it can be prescribed for patients of all ages means our priority should be to make this available as soon as humanly possible to senior citizens who are the most vulnerable demographic. Here is the abstract from a study conducted in China:The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China. Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China. The drug is recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19 infection in larger populations in the future. And here is an abstract from a study reported in the journal Nature. It’s titled ‘Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro.’Chloroquine, a widely-used anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug, has recently been reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug. Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV. Our time-of-addition assay demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry, and at post-entry stages of the 2019-nCoV infection in Vero E6 cells... Chloroquine is widely distributed in the whole body, including lung, after oral administration...Chloroquine is a cheap and a safe drug that has been used for more than 70 years and, therefore, it is potentially clinically applicable against the 2019-nCoV.Well, if the problem is FDA approval for this use, Trump can direct the FDA to accelerate the approval process and get this thing in circulation. And the beauty here is that the drug could be prescribed today, right now. No need to wait. Trump should persuade Congress to immediately authorize doctors to prescribe it, and indemnify them against any lawsuits. Because chloroquine is a generic drug, no pharmaceutical companies will have any interest in producing it since they can’t make any money off it. They’ll want to convince us all that the only solution is a vaccine, which hasn’t even been approved yet. By the time we wait for all that to happen, there may be many lives lost and no economy left to save. The UK has actually banned the export of chloroquine, likely because they know it works and they want to have existing supplies in reserve for their own citizens. Britain first and all that. Medical professionals in both China and South Korea have developed effective treatment measures using chloroquine for patients with COVID-19, so there’s no need to reinvent the wheel. The drug works. “Studies showed ‘certain curative effect’ with ‘fairly good efficacy’ … patients treated with chloroquine demonstrated a better drop in fever, improvement of lung CT images, and required a shorter time to recover” than untreated patients. So it can actually cure people who have coronavirus, end their fevers, and shorten their time in hospital. This can keep our health system from getting overloaded and collapsing under its own weight. If the drug is preventative as well as curative, you would expect to find the countries that have malaria, and therefore have used chloroquine for decades, would have lower rates of Coronavirus if this theory is correct. Dr. Roy Spencer plotted the data for 234 countries, comparing total cases of COVID-19 to the incidence of malaria. He was astonished at what he found. In the top 40 malaria countries, with an average of 212 cases of malaria per thousand, the rate of COVID-19 is 0.2 cases per thousand. In the 153 countries with no malaria, the rate is 68.7 cases of Coronavirus per thousand. When Dr. Spencer mapped all this out, the conclusion was unambiguous: “COVID-19 is where malaria is not.” Said Dr. Spencer, “In all my years of data analysis I have never seen such a stark and strong relationship: Countries with malaria basically have no COVID-19 cases.” This is where Congress could actually do something intelligent by taking some of the billions and billions and billions of dollars they are mindlessly throwing at this problem and targeting it to fund mass production of this medicine. Nobody will mind if they provide a profit margin to Big Pharma in the process if it will save countless lives and pull our economy back from the abyss while we wait for the vaccine. Since chloroquine can not only prevent the disease but cure it, we can begin to see immediate effects. We can get past this irrational, out-of-control, economy-destroying hysteria, save lives, and get the American economy back on its feet and humming in weeks, not months. There is no time to lose. President Trump, over to you.",0
"The blaring headline in Newsweek: DR. FAUCI BACKED CONTROVERSIAL WUHAN LAB WITH U.S. DOLLARS FOR RISKY CORONAVIRUS RESEARCH. Did Dr. Anthony Fauci fund, with American taxpayer dollars, the research that produced the coronavirus that has shut down and locked up the mightiest and most free nation in history? The answer is, “Probably yes.” Should he have known better? The answer is, “Indubitably yes.” Dr. Fauci has been virtually worshiped as an icon by the press and the public has been played by Brad Pitt on Saturday Night Live and is being considered for Sexiest Man of the Year. According to Newsweek, he is something of “an American folk hero for his calm, steady leadership” during the crisis. Just last year, Dr. Fauci, who heads up the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH), sent the scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology a boatload of money to pursue gain-of-function research on bat viruses, research which has been going on at Wuhan for years. “Gain-of-function” refers to research that involves manipulating viruses in the lab “to explore their potential for infecting humans.” (Emphasis mine throughout.) Writes Newsweek, “Gain-of-function techniques have been used to turn viruses into human pathogens capable of causing a global pandemic.” The catastrophic risks, should one of these manipulated viruses escape containment, are obvious. The U.S. Embassy warned in January of 2018 that the Wuhan Institute had a record of shoddy practices that could lead to an accidental release. According to its cable, “[T]he new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.” The Obama administration was so alarmed by worries about an outbreak that they suspended support for this kind of research at Wuhan in 2014. But when Trump took office, Fauci was able to persuade him that it was safe, and the project resumed in 2017. The second tranche of multi-million dollar funding came in 2019, and this stash was particularly devoted to understanding how bat coronaviruses could mutate to attack humans. The National Institutes of Health canceled this project for a second time on April 24, just two weeks ago. Dr. Fauci has not responded to Newsweek’s request for comment. Richard Ebright, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers University, said the project description refers to experiments that are designed to enhance the ability of bat coronavirus to infect human cells through genetic engineering. The risk of causing a pandemic through an accidental release from the lab is obviously a prime concern. Our intelligence agencies now believe the pandemic outbreak may have emerged “accidentally” due to “unsafe laboratory practices” at the Wuhan lab. 
This research at WIV, research funded with our tax dollars, was dedicated to deliberately creating a version of a bat virus that could be transmitted to humans. The insane purpose here was ostensibly to develop such a virus so it could be studied and a therapeutic response developed before it caused a worldwide pandemic. This kind of research is so obviously crazy and dangerous that 200 research scientists wrote a letter pleading that such foolish and potentially lethal research be terminated. But the NIH, under the direction of Dr. Fauci, sent $3.7 million to the WIV lab in 2014, and then showered the Chinese scientists at this lab with another $3.7 million in 2019 to keep their work going, the work of developing a bat virus that could attack people. Two back-to-back 5-year projects that took $7.4 million out of taxpayer pockets and out of the United States. When the NIH ended Obama’s moratorium on this research, and the second phase of research began, NIH established a framework to determine how the research would go forward. The heart of the framework was that scientists would have to get approval from a panel of experts who would decide whether the obvious risks were justified. The kicker here is that these reviews were conducted in secret. After Science magazine discovered that NIH had approved two influenza projects using gain-of-function methods, scientists rightly opposed to this kind of research wrote a scathing editorial in the Washington Post. The authors were Tom Inglesby of Johns Hopkins and Mark Liptsitch of Harvard. “We have serious doubts about whether these experiments should be conducted at all. With deliberations kept behind closed doors, none of us will have the opportunity to understand how the government arrived at these decisions or to judge the rigor and integrity of that process."" Dr. Fauci began working in earnest on gain-of-function research over a decade ago, in connection with bird-flu viruses. The research involved taking wild viruses and passing them through live animals until they mutated into a form that could actually pose a pandemic threat. These researchers would take a virus that was poorly transmitted among humans and turn it into one that was highly transmissible. Ferrets were the animals of choice. Ferrets were deliberately infected and researchers allowed the virus to mutate in the lab’s ferret colony. The mutations continued until the virus was able to infect a ferret that had not been deliberately infected with the disease. Researcher Ron Fouchier of Erasmus University in Holland knew he had succeeded when a virus jumped from an infected ferret to an uninfected ferret in an adjacent cage who had had no contact with the infected animal. Transmissibility had been achieved, and Fouchier had created a pandemic-causing virus in his lab. Fouchier's work, wrote Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch in the journal Nature in 2015, ""entails a unique risk that a laboratory accident could spark a pandemic, killing millions."" A consortium of 17 scientists, the Cambridge Working Group, issued a statement of protest, that was eventually endorsed by 200 scientists (mentioned above) because well, accidents happen. Here’s how the statement read in part: “Laboratory creation of highly transmissible, novel strains of dangerous viruses...poses substantially increased risks. An accidental infection in such a setting could trigger outbreaks that would be difficult or impossible to control.” Fauci defended this kind of research in a 2011 op-ed in the Washington Post, writing that “information gained through biomedical research...provides a critical foundation...for generating countermeasures, and, ultimately protecting the public health.” Bottom line: it appears that dangerously misguided research in Wuhan, funded by U.S. taxpayer dollars under the direction of Dr. Fauci, created the virus that is now plaguing the world. The research was allowed to continue by Dr. Fauci despite warnings from 200 prominent scientists that such research was exceedingly dangerous. It may be time to ask whether Dr. Fauci is in the right place at the right time.",0
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses.How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director. In connection with the SARS outbreak - caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV - the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the cell and infect the victim.The Virology Journal - the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health - published what is now a blockbuster article on August 22, 2005, under the heading - get ready for this - “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” (Emphasis mine throughout.) Write the researchers, “We report...that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.”This means, of course, that Dr. Fauci (pictured at right) has known for 15 years that chloroquine and it’s even milder derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will not only treat a current case of coronavirus (“therapeutic”) but prevent future cases (“prophylactic”). So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine. In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus. Said Dr. Fauci’s NIH in 2005, “concentrations of 10 μM completely abolished SARS-CoV infection.” Fauci’s researchers add, “chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV.”Dr. Didier Raoult, the Anthony Fauci of France, had such spectacular success using HCQ to treat victims of SARS-CoV-2 that he said way back on February 25 that “it’s game over” for coronavirus.He and a team of researchers reported that the use of HCQ administered with both azithromycin and zinc cured 79 of 80 patients with only “rare and minor” adverse events. “In conclusion,” these researchers write, “we confirm the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early impairment of contagiousness.”The highly-publicized VA study that purported to show HCQ was ineffective showed nothing of the sort. HCQ wasn’t administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms.
But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas.Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2.On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That’s not the “anecdotal” evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings.“Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.”Said Dr. Zelenko:""If you scale this nationally, the economy will rebound much quicker. The country will open again. And let me tell you a very important point. This treatment costs about $20. That’s very important because you can scale that nationally. If every treatment costs $20,000, that’s not so good.All I’m doing is repurposing old, available drugs which we know their safety profiles, and using them in a unique combination in an outpatient setting.""The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn’t it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it’s not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms.While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, “As a physician, this baffles me. I can’t think of a single infectious condition — bacterial, fungal, or viral — where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.”So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn’t even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died.This may be why: “Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases...is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV.” That’s the problem. It is safe, inexpensive, and it works - in other words, there’s nothing sexy or avant-garde about HCQ. It’s been around since 1934.Given human nature, it’s possible, even likely, that those who are chasing the unicorn of a coronavirus vaccine are doing so for reasons other than human health. I can’t see into anybody’s heart, and can’t presume to know their motives, but on the other hand, human nature recognizes that there’s no glory in pushing HCQ, and nobody is going to get anything named for him in the history books. The polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1954, and it is still known as the “Salk vaccine.” There will be no “Fauci vaccine” if HCQ is the answer to the problem.So while Dr. Fauci is tut-tutting and pooh-poohing HCQ, Dr. Raoult and Dr. Zelensky are out there saving lives at $20 a pop. Maybe we should spend more time listening to them than the wizards-of-smart bureaucrats the Talking Snake Media fawns over.Dr. Fauci is regarded by the Talking Snake Media as the Oracle at Delphi. The entire nation hangs on his every word. But if nobody is dying and nobody is locked down, his 15 minutes of fame fades to zero. Very few people are not going to be influenced by that prospect, especially when it’s easy to keep the attention of the public by continuing to feed the panic.It should not be overlooked that there is no money in HCQ for Big Pharma since HCQ is a generic that can be manufactured so cheaply there is little profit margin in it. On the other hand, the payday for a vaccine will literally be off-the-charts. Who knows what kind of behind-the-scenes pressure is being put on Fauci and others in the health care establishment?There is a monstrous reputational risk for those who will be found to have dismissively waved off a treatment that could have been used from the very beginning, even back on February 15 when Dr. Fauci said that the risk from Coronavirus was “minuscule.” How many lives could have been saved if the heads of our multi-billion dollar health care bureaucracy had been advocating for HCQ treatment from day one? We’ll never know. Instead, their advice has been dangerous and deadly in every sense of that word.Someday - maybe even today - we will be able to identify the individuals who had the knowledge and expertise to make a global difference, but turned up their noses at the solution when it could have made all the difference in the world.",0

"Two doctors in the Bakersfield area want the California shelter-in-place order to be lifted.Dr. Dan Erickson and Dr. Artin Massihi own and run an urgent care facility in Kern County.“Do we need to still shelter in place? Our answer is no. Do we need businesses to be shut down? No. Do we need to test them and get them back to work? Yes we do,” says Dr. Dan Erickson.The two say they have their own statistics that show COVID-19 is similar to the flu.Dr. Daniel Erickson is questioning the effectiveness of going into lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He believes we should be focusing on ""Herd Immunity"" and backed up his claim with statistics on Good Morning San Diego. sheltering in place would lead to a weakening of the immune system, because this would limit exposure to “normal bacteria and normal flora”. While it is correct that healthy development of the immune system requires exposure to microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and viruses, sheltering in place would not minimize exposure to microorganisms to the extent of causing immune dysfunction.",0
"Contrary to the narrative that is being pushed by the mainstream that the COVID 19 virus was the result of a natural mutation and that it was transmitted to humans from bats via pangolins, Dr Luc Montagnier the man who discovered the HIV virus back in 1983 disagrees and is saying that the virus was man made.Professor Luc Montagnier, 2008 Nobel Prize winner for Medicine, claims that SARS-CoV-2 is a manipulated virus that was accidentally released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. Chinese researchers are said to have used coronaviruses in their work to develop an AIDS vaccine. HIV RNA fragments are believed to have been found in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.We knew that the Chinese version of how the coronavirus emerged was increasingly under attack, but here’s a thesis that tells a completely different story about the Covid-19 pandemic, which is already responsible for more than 110,000 deaths worldwide. According to Professor Luc Montagnier, winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2008 for “discovering” HIV as the cause of the AIDS epidemic together with Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, the SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that was manipulated and accidentally released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, in the last quarter of 2019. According to Professor Montagnier, this laboratory,known for its work on coronaviruses, tried to use one of these viruses as a vector for HIV in the search for an AIDS vaccine!With my colleague, bio-mathematician Jean-Claude Perez, we carefully analyzed the description of the genome of this RNA virus,” explains Luc Montagnier, interviewed by Dr Jean-François Lemoine for the daily podcast at Pourquoi Docteur, adding that others have already explored this avenue: Indian researchers have already tried to publish the results of the analyses that showed that this coronavirus genome contained sequences of another virus, … the HIV virus (AIDS virus), but they were forced to withdraw their findings as the pressure from the mainstream was too great.To insert an HIV sequence into this genome requires molecular tools. In a challenging question Dr Jean-François Lemoine inferred that the coronavirus under investigation may have come from a patient who is otherwise infected with HIV. No, “says Luc Montagnier,” in order to insert an HIV sequence into this genome, molecular tools are needed, and that can only be done in a laboratory.According to the 2008 Nobel Prize for Medicine, a plausible explanation would be an accident in the Wuhan laboratory. He also added that the purpose of this work was the search for an AIDS vaccine.The truth will eventually come out. In any case, this thesis, defended by Professor Luc Montagnier, has a positive turn. According to him, the altered elements of this virus are eliminated as it spreads: “Nature does not accept any molecular tinkering, it will eliminate these unnatural changes and even if nothing is done, things will get better, but unfortunately after many deaths.”This is enough to feed some heated debates! So much so that Professor Montagnier’s statements could also place him in the category of “conspiracy theorists”: “Conspirators are the opposite camp, hiding the truth,” he replies, without wanting to accuse anyone, but hoping that the Chinese will admit to what he believes happened in their laboratory.To entice a confession from the Chinese he used the example of Iran which after taking full responsibility for accidentally hitting a Ukrainian plane was able to earn the respect of the global community. Hopefully the Chinese will do the right thing he adds. “In any case, the truth always comes out, it is up to the Chinese government to take responsibility.”",0
"Professor Luc Montagnier, independent researcher and 2008 Nobel Prize winner for medicine for his discovery of HIV, was a guest of André Bercoff on Thursday 30 April, at Sud Radio.provoked a controversy a few weeks ago by expressing his doubts about the origin of the coronavirus.Now an independent researcher, the 2008 Nobel Prize in Medicine defended his point of view that the Coronavirus is man made in an interview by André Bercoff. For him, the most likely hypothesis is that the virus accidentally escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan.The first infected weren’t in the market.Luc Montagnier, a researcher specializing in viruses for “a very long time”, was sometimes questioned, but above all he was distinguished by the fact that he was a member of the panel of experts who discovered HIV. In the midst of the pandemic, the professor inevitably became interested in Covid-19 very quickly: “It is interesting to know its origins, because we can derive new therapeutic tests from it and know what will happen to this epidemic in the future,” he explains.
The official version of the appearance of the coronavirus says that the coronavirus started at the fish market in Wuhan, where animals carrying the virus were bought and eaten, recalls Luc Montagnier. “This is a theory that does not correspond exactly to the reality of the facts,” he questions. “The first infected people were not in the market, they were more likely to be near the nearby laboratory,” the professor emphasizes.Experiments for over ten years
In these laboratories, Chinese scientists “have been working for more than ten years on coronaviruses transmitted by animals, especially bats,” reports Professor Montagnier, who regularly reviews published reports. The experiments, which began after the SARS epidemic in Asia in 2003, were carried out by the Chinese scientists. “Bats are considered healthy carriers and therefore carry many viruses,” he explains. According to his hypothesis, “some of these researchers have tried to identify factors that could make these bats dangerous to humans. They started with a very similar model, but it was neither contagious nor pathogenic for humans because it had no receptor,” the professor suspects.Luc Montagnier, hopes that one day “scientists will say so themselves. But at the moment “we are in such a climate; there are so many dead that nobody wants to carry this very heavy burden”, he admits. Another questionable problem is that one of these laboratories “is financed by the United States, and for quite a lot of money”. “It is also a factor that explains why nobody wants to bring the truth to light,” regrets Luc Montagnier.Montagnier also discussed the presence of those HIV segments that are present in the novel coronavirus. He admits although similar segments might be present in other viruses, what remains highly suspicious is that all of these segments are all present in a small section of the coronavirus. Additionaly as the virus is mutating it seems to be mutating in those areas where the HIV segments were added.  According to him, the altered elements of this virus are eliminated as it spreads: “Nature does not accept any molecular tinkering, it will eliminate these unnatural changes and even if nothing is done, things will get better, but unfortunately after many deaths.”",0
"Vitamins C and D are now finally being adopted in the conventional treatment of novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Vitamin C at extremely high doses acts as an antiviral drug, actually killing viruses. Although vitamin D does not appear to have a direct effect on the virus itself, it does strengthen immune function, thus allowing the host body to combat the virus more effectively.",0
"Could the new coronavirus have been created in a lab? Writing in Medium, Youthereum Genetics CEO Yuri Deigin said that he believes it’s quite plausible. He writes that labs across the planet have been creating viruses just like this one for a long time, and while skeptics say that there would be some sign of human manipulation in its genome, modern genetic engineering tools enable genomic fragments to be cut and pasted without leaving a single trace. Not only that, but he insists it’s something that can be carried out quickly, citing the fact that a Swiss team created an authentic clone of CoV2 in under a month.At first, Deigin thought the idea of the virus being a lab creation was little more than a conspiracy theory. In fact, it was only when he was researching the situation to support his belief that he first started having doubts. One big red flag? As he looked further into the research activities coronavirologists have been carrying out in the past two decades, he found that making chimeras like CoV2 was pretty common in their labs.Moreover, he said that virologists like the coronavirus research leader at Wuhan Institute of Virology, Shi Zhengli, have been doing precisely this type of thing since at least 2007. In 2017, they created eight new chimeric coronaviruses there. They even said in an NIH grant that they wanted to create live synthetic viral clones for research purposes.Nobel Prize laureate Luc Montagnier, a co-discoverer of HIV, agrees with the lab theory. He believes that COVID-19 resulted from an attempt to create a vaccine for AIDS that escaped from a lab, although his analysis has not yet been peer reviewed. He thinks that it came about from inserting DNA sequences from HIV into a coronavirus.A third of Americans believe coronavirus was made in a lab.According to a survey, almost a third of Americans believe coronavirus was indeed a lab creation. The Pew Research Center survey, which was carried out between March 10 and 16, involved nearly 9,000 adults. Twenty-nine percent of Americans said they thought the virus was most likely created in a lab. Nearly a quarter of adults say they think the strain currently wreaking havoc on the world was developed intentionally in a lab; 6 percent think it was most likely made by accident.Younger people are even more convinced, with a third of adults between the ages of 18 and 29 thinking it was developed in a lab versus 21 percent of adults aged 65 and older who believe the same. The survey revealed several other divides as well. People with a bachelor’s degree or higher were less likely than those with less education to say the new virus was created in a lab, while more Republicans than Democrats believed it was lab-born at 37 percent versus 21 percent.For his part, Deigin says that there’s no evidence of what really happened, but he does believe there has been a series of strange coincidences that are hard to ignore. He said that for CoV2 to have arisen naturally, bat and pangolin strains would have needed to meet in the same cell of an animal in Wuhan, where the outbreak started. However, since bats weren’t sold at the Wuhan market and tend to hibernate at that time of year and no other carriers of ancestral strains have been found, natural emergence is also difficult to prove.There’s also the fact that American experts raised concerns after a 2018 visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology about safety within the lab, particularly when it came to their work with bat coronaviruses. They contacted Washington to ask for more U.S. attention and support to the lab to help correct these issues. They noted a shortage of trained technicians and investigators there at the time.We may never know how this deadly disease got its start, as Deigin said a good genetic engineer would be able to create a synthetic virus that is impossible to distinguish from a natural one. He added that he doesn’t want his post to be used to propagate one-sided theories, but he does wish to draw attention to the dangers of the gain-of-function research that goes on in virology.",0
"For three months, we’ve been urging our readers to pursue sensible nutritional strategies to boost immune function and protect against infections. Now a study carried out by Northwestern University has found that higher vitamin D levels result in lower mortality rates from covid-19 infections.Vitamin D deficiency, according to the study, was significantly linked to the development of severe symptoms and complications leading to death.
The study, published in medRxiv, is entitled, “The Possible Role of Vitamin D in Suppressing Cytokine Storm and Associated Mortality in COVID-19 Patients.”The study used data from coronavirus patients across multiple nations, including the UK, the USA, China, France, Italy and South Korea. Those patients who had the lowest vitamin D levels had the highest risk of complications such as the “cytokine storm” immune reaction that leads to rapid death.
“[W]e saw a significant correlation with vitamin D deficiency,” says study author Vadim Backman.The research paper concludes, “Our finding suggests that Vit. D may reduce COVID-19 severity by suppressing cytokine storm in COVID-19 patieThe paper is careful to note that vitamin D should not be considered a kind of miracle cure for covid-19 and that more research needs to be conducted to further explore the relationship.The paper was also covered by StudyFinds.org, which explains:All of the data used for this study was publicly available, and an in-depth analysis revealed a correlation between vitamin D levels and cytokine storm (a form of hyper-inflammation due to an overactive immune system). A relationship between vitamin D and mortality rates among COVID-19 patients was noted as well.So, the research team believe vitamin D is helpful against COVID-19 because it simultaneously boosts our existing immune systems while also preventing new immune responses from going over board.“Our analysis shows that it might be as high as cutting the mortality rate in half,” Backman says. “It will not prevent a patient from contracting the virus, but it may reduce complications and prevent death in those who are infected.”However, it is clear that vitamin D deficiency is harmful, and it can be easily addressed with appropriate supplementation. This might be another key to helping protect vulnerable populations, such as African-American and elderly patients, who have a prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.Why is no government leader recommend vitamin D or zinc?With research like this clearly showing a drastic reduction in mortality from a simple, low-cost and very safe supplement that’s widely available right now, it begs the question: Why isn’t anyone in government recommending nutrition as a way to protect public health while we attempt to reopen the economy?Even worse, why are governors restricting people from going to the beach where they generate vitamin D for free as they are absorbing healing sunlight? That’s the beauty of vitamin D: Your body makes it at no charge, but not if you’re locked down in your own home, which seems to be part of the big plan to cause mass suffering and death.President Trump is pushing hard for 300 million doses of a vaccine by the end of the year, but he completely fails to mention vitamin D and zinc. These solutions could be saving lives right now, and they don’t need months (or years) or testing, since they have a long track record of safe, effective use (and are incredibly affordable).The real answer, of course, is that Big Pharma doesn’t want people to stay healthy with nutrition. They’d rather see people sick and suffering, waiting for a vaccine or another high-priced prescription drug that barely even works (like remdesivir, which saves no lives at all).And since the drug companies run the White House, the media, Big Tech and medical schools, there’s virtually no one in any position of power that’s willing to risk the ire of the drug companies by recommending safe, simple, low-cost nutritional supplements that might make drugs and vaccines obsolete.
The Big Pharma scheme, you see, demands that the American people stay locked down until there’s a vaccine, at which time the entire US economy will be shattered and beyond repair.Trump should order the government to manufacture vitamin D + zinc supplements and give them away to all Americans This is why I’ve called for the government to manufacture and give away key supplements that may help prevent coronavirus infections. For a fraction of the price of the multi-trillion-dollar bailouts that have already been paid, the federal government could provide free vitamin D, zinc and vitamin C for the entire population.Health care costs would plummet across the board, and Big Pharma would lose hundreds of billions of dollars as fewer people are diagnosed with a long list of diseases and chronic conditions that are prevented through nutrition. And that’s exactly why any plan to keep America healthy will be halted by those in power. A healthy nation doesn’t need Big Pharma, and Big Pharma provides the re-election campaign money that keeps corrupt lawmakers in power. The drug cartels also provide about 70% of the ad revenue to the corrupt mainstream media, which is why the media relentlessly attacks natural remedies while pushing toxic, high-profit prescription drugs and vaccines.So to keep the gravy train rolling, they have to keep the American people locked down and sick. That’s why knowledge about nutrition is also being censored by Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Google, among other tech platforms.That’s partly why I’ve been banned everywhere: Because I’ve been promoting nutrition and disease prevention for two decades, costing the drug giants hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenues.You absolutely must watch this important mini-documentary to learn more about how Big Pharma is using the coronavirus pandemic to enslave the human race and trap people in a cycle of disease and harmful vaccinations:",0
"For months, the establishment has been dishing out a narrative claiming that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is a natural, albeit mysterious and unexplained, phenomenon that probably originated at a Chinese meat market. But contrary evidence continues to surface suggesting that the virus actually originated inside a Chinese laboratory and research center.Many virologists continue to deny this, of course, claiming that there is no evidence to support the notion that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) might in any way be unnatural. But the genetic hallmarks they are looking for as proof may not be as evident as previously believed because modern genetic engineering can be done without leaving a trace.Believe it or not, a Swiss research team was able to create a synthetic clone of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) in less than a month. And they did this by inserting genetic fragments in such a way that, unless a scientist knows exactly what to look for, would not necessarily be apparent.
Over the past 15-20 years, researchers have been actively studying, dissecting, reconstructing and otherwise tampering with coronaviruses of various types. This includes the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which one scientific researcher describes as an “obvious chimera,” meaning it is a combination of at least two pre-existing viruses.This scientist, who goes by the name of Yuri Deigin and edits the Open Longevity journal both in Russian and English, says that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is based on an ancestral bat strain of coronavirus known as RaTG13, but with a replaced receptor binding motif (RBM) in its spike protein.
The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) also contains an added stretch of four different amino acids that he says were inserted into the virus, creating a furin cleavage site “that, as virologists have previously established, significantly expands the ‘repertoire’ of the virus in terms of whose cells it can penetrate.”Because of this, Deigin speculates, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was probably able to mutate and jump species, leaving its original host and infecting humans. And it just so happens that this very type of research was taking place at the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China, which is where the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) originated.Virologists like Shi Zhengli, Deigin points out, have “done many similar things in the past,” including replacing the RBM in one type of virus with the RBM of another. They have also added new furin sites to coronaviruses, creating new artificial species-specific coronaviruses that borrow from other coronaviruses in their ability to do new things.Now this does not necessarily mean that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was an intentional bioweapon, at least in Deigin’s view. It could be that it was an experiment gone wrong rather than an intentional effort at plunging the entire world into a pandemic. At the same time, it does seem clear that the virus did, in fact, come from a lab, and probably from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Teams led by Shi Zhengli have created at least eight artificial chimeric coronaviruses over the years, and received money from NIH. Deigin uncovered that between the years of 2007 and 2017, Shi Zhengli and colleagues created at least eight new chimeric coronaviruses with a variety of RBMs. And in 2019, the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) actually gave the Wuhan Institute of Virology $3.7 million as part of a grant entitled, Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence.That same year, Shi Zhengli co-authored a paper calling for continued research into these and other synthetic viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, arguing that there are “no clinical treatments or prevention strategies” currently available with regard to human coronaviruses.All of this is highly suspicious, seeing as how 2019 was the very same year that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) first emerged in China, and in the same city where Shi Zhengli and colleagues were working on similar coronaviruses. There is little doubt that this chimeric virus originated in that lab, despite continued denial by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).But it no longer matters what the CCP claims as people all over the world are figuring out the truth on their own. It is at least apparent that something went amiss with the containment of this virus, and it is possible that whatever happened was intentional.Deigin lays out the details from Shi Zhengli’s 2019 paper about the relative ease with which even a graduate student in the field could create such a virus. He also spells out the detailed biology of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) as evidence that it definitely matches the type of thing that Shi Zhengli describes.Based on the evidence he puts forth, which you can peruse in its entirety at this link, the only logical conclusion is that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is genetically modified and came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He also traces the origins of the RaTG13 strain from which the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was derived.
Amazingly, Shi Zhengli admitted just this year that she was the one who isolated RaTG13 back in 2013 from Yunnan horseshoe bats of the Rhinolophus affinis variety. None of this was known, however, until January 2020 when the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) first started arriving in the U.S.
All of this absolutely implicates communist China in the unleashing of this global pandemic, not to mention the NIH that helped to fund this type of research. Heads need to roll, and those who have been victimized by this thing – including everyone who has been forced into lockdown – deserves a full measure of justice.
Bioweapon or not, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is a product of China, as well as a product of our own federal government. And both entities need to be held accountable for the roles they played in scourging the planet with this invisible beast.On the other hand, if it was all just an accident as Deigin believes was probably the case, then those involved need to fess up and admit their error rather than continue to claim that all just some wild conspiracy theory.",0
"Over the last month or so, it has become increasingly obvious to pandemic observers that “death science” operators like Dr. Fauci have been deeply involved in funding the development of bioengineering research that led to the creation (and release) of the Wuhan coronavirus which has now killed at least a quarter of a million people worldwide.Even Newsweek — a globalist publication that usually defends depopulation advocates — is now pointing out the ties between Dr. Fauci and the biological engineering industry that gives rise to bioweapons designed to exterminate humanity. “[J]ust last year, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the organization led by Dr. Fauci, funded scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and other institutions for work on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses,” reports Newsweek.com, adding: (emphasis added) In 2019, with the backing of NIAID, the National Institutes of Health committed $3.7 million over six years for research that included some gain-of-function work. The program followed another $3.7 million, 5-year project for collecting and studying bat coronaviruses, which ended in 2019, bringing the total to $7.4 million.Many scientists have criticized gain of function research, which involves manipulating viruses in the lab to explore their potential for infecting humans, because it creates a risk of starting a pandemic from accidental release.
Dr. Fauci, in other words, helped funnel money into a program that the scientists knew was working to develop “gain-of-function” properties that could result in a global pandemic. They even collaborated with communist China to conduct the research, even though China is an enemy of humanity and has a long history of accidental releases of level-4 biohazard specimens.Engineering a weapon system to specifically attack human physiology
Part of the research Dr. Fauci funded was specifically looking for ways to make bat coronavirus strains attack humans. As Newsweek explains:A second phase of the project, beginning that year, included additional surveillance work but also gain-of-function research for the purpose of understanding how bat coronaviruses could mutate to attack humans. The project was run by EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit research group, under the direction of President Peter Daszak, an expert on disease ecology. NIH canceled the project just this past Friday, April 24th, Politico reported.The proposal of that project specifically details how they planned to built a biological weapon that could devastate humankind:The project proposal states: “We will use S protein sequence data, infectious clone technology, in vitro and in vivo infection experiments and analysis of receptor binding to test the hypothesis that % divergence thresholds in S protein sequences predict spillover potential.”
In layman’s terms, “spillover potential” refers to the ability of a virus to jump from animals to humans, which requires that the virus be able to attach to receptors in the cells of humans.In other words, this is the use of genetic engineering technology to build biological weapons that are designed and intended to exterminate human life.Hundreds of scientists called for a halt to the dangerous research, but Dr. Fauci made sure the grant money kept flowing
As Newsweek further explains:According to Richard Ebright, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers University, the project description refers to experiments that would enhance the ability of bat coronavirus to infect human cells and laboratory animals using techniques of genetic engineering. In the wake of the pandemic, that is a noteworthy detail.Ebright, along with many other scientists, has been a vocal opponent of gain-of-function research because of the risk it presents of creating a pandemic through accidental release from a lab.The work entailed risks that worried even seasoned researchers. More than 200 scientists called for the work to be halted. The problem, they said, is that it increased the likelihood that a pandemic would occur through a laboratory accident… Dr. Fauci defended the work.Dr. Fauci, it turns out, has been a key cheerleader for this “death science” research for decades. He has also been credibly accused by Dr. Judy Mikovitz and other virologists of stealing intellectual property and stifling whistleblowers who sought to expose the truth about NIH-funded research and how it threatens humanity. Hundreds of other scientists have publicly and repeatedly blasted Dr. Fauci and the NIH for their work in building weapons against humanity. Again, from Newsweek:In early 2019, after a reporter for Science magazine discovered that the NIH had approved two influenza research projects that used gain of function methods, scientists who oppose this kind of research excoriated the NIH in an editorial in the Washington Post.“We have serious doubts about whether these experiments should be conducted at all,” wrote Tom Inglesby of Johns Hopkins University and Marc Lipsitch of Harvard.At what point do we invoke the death sentence for those found guilty of building devastating weapons of mass destruction that kill the innocent?
Prof. Francis Boyle has long called for the death sentence for scientists who are found guilty of engaging in research intended to build biological weapons that target human beings. That appears to be precisely what Dr. Fauci has done over a career spanning decades. It begs the obvious question: Should Dr. Fauci be criminally investigated and prosecuted for carrying out crimes against humanity? And if found guilty, should he face the death penalty? Should other scientists who knowingly collaborated on this project share the same fate?Right now, without exception, every scientist tied to the Wuhan Virology Institute and its gain-of-function research claims the Wuhan coronavirus couldn’t possibly have come from a lab. They are lying to the world, 0ly claiming the insertion of gene sequences into the virus are the result of natural, zoological mutations in the wild. The reason they’re lying, of course, is because they know they are guilty of building a weapon that has already killed a quarter of a million innocent people, and they correctly fear that if the truth gets out, they may face criminal prosecutions themselves.Our society sentences murderers to death after they’ve killed a single person.

Trump appears to have been mesmerized by Dr. Fauci’s vaccine promises, and Dr. Fauci is being celebrated by the liberal media as a hero for humanity rather than the death science doctor he more accurately represents.

So far, it appears Trump lacks the scientific knowledge to even recognize when he’s being manipulated by death science operators like Fauci. And with Trump now pushing for 300 million doses of an obviously experimental, untested coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year, it almost seems as if Dr. Fauci is setting up Trump to take the fall for a vaccine public health catastrophe that ends in mass fatalities and the end of the Trump administration after millions of Americans die from either the coronavirus or the vaccine itself (or a combination where the vaccine causes an “enhanced” immune response to subsequent infections, killing millions).It also raises the obvious question: If society feels justified in ending the life of a murderer who is found guilty of killing one person, what should be the punishment for those who use science to build murderous weapons that kill hundreds of thousands or millions of people?Even more alarmingly, this “death science” research continues to be conducted right now, via the NIH and Dr. Fauci himself.

21K. Should “death science” operatives like Dr. Fauci face the DEATH SENTENCE if found guilty of collaborating to build the Wuhan coronavirus bioweapon?
(Natural News) Over the last month or so, it has become increasingly obvious to pandemic observers that “death science” operators like Dr. Fauci have been deeply involved in funding the development of bioengineering research that led to the creation (and release) of the Wuhan coronavirus which has now killed at least a quarter of a million people worldwide.Even Newsweek — a globalist publication that usually defends depopulation advocates — is now pointing out the ties between Dr. Fauci and the biological engineering industry that gives rise to bioweapons designed to exterminate humanity. “[J]ust last year, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the organization led by Dr. Fauci, funded scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and other institutions for work on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses,” reports Newsweek.com, adding:In 2019, with the backing of NIAID, the National Institutes of Health committed $3.7 million over six years for research that included some gain-of-function work. The program followed another $3.7 million, 5-year project for collecting and studying bat coronaviruses, which ended in 2019, bringing the total to $7.4 million.
Many scientists have criticized gain of function research, which involves manipulating viruses in the lab to explore their potential for infecting humans, because it creates a risk of starting a pandemic from accidental release.Dr. Fauci, in other words, helped funnel money into a program that the scientists knew was working to develop “gain-of-function” properties that could result in a global pandemic. They even collaborated with communist China to conduct the research, even though China is an enemy of humanity and has a long history of accidental releases of level-4 biohazard specimens.Engineering a weapon system to specifically attack human physiology.Part of the research Dr. Fauci funded was specifically looking for ways to make bat coronavirus strains attack humans.

I’d rather see a dozen bioweapons scientists burn up in the atmosphere than see another round of coronavirus devastate human society and crush our global economy.By the way, what are Dr. Fauci’s ties to vaccine manufacturers and pharma drug cartels? Isn’t he acting out of a conflicted desire to protect his own financial interests rather than prioritize what’s best for public health? It seems to me that Dr. Fauci has all the characteristics of a super villain like The Penguin from the Batman series, or possibly Doctor Octopus from the Marvel universe. He’s desperately to achieve a celebrity-like public image while secretly plotting to build weapons to exterminate human beings, all while siphoning money from the public to fund his demonic, anti-human research.It almost sounds like a comic book villain… except it’s real, and this guy is practically I think it’s time that we all demanded a criminal investigation and possible prosecution of Dr. Fauci and all the other “death science” pushers who were complicit in the funding of the gain-of-function coronavirus research in the Wuhan lab.These people belong behind bars. They are enemies of humanity and criminals whose heinous crimes span the entirety of human history. What Dr. Fauci has done to humanity ranks with the mass murders carried out by Stalin, Mao and even the Third Reich. And we will be lucky indeed if the number of coronavirus fatalities around the world somehow manages to stay under six million by the time this deadly bioengineered weapon has run its course.Dr. Fauci, you have blood on your hands. The real question is: Will the American people demand he be held accountable? Or will they stupidly declare him a “hero” for pushing vaccines that he claims will treat the very same weapon system that he helped fund and build in the first place?It’s time for America to rise up against the death science industry and demand arrests and prosecutions of all those scientists who took part in building this weapon system against humanity. By building weapons that are deliberately designed to kill and maim innocent human beings, they have forfeited their right to exist in our society.",0
"As part of an upcoming presentation with GenSix.com, which streams on May 15-16th, I’ve been working to organization information that describes the “trifecta” of death science weapons which are now aimed at humanity. What I’m calling the “death science trifecta” consists of the coronavirus (biological weapons), 5G towers (electromagnetic weapons) and vaccines (chemical weapons). In combination, they are designed to enslave and then exterminate most human beings living today.That’s why there’s no real talk of restoring human freedom, or promoting pro-human free speech or even allowing anyone to advocate nutrition that can save lives. The globalists have zero interest in saving humanity… they are working to exterminate billions of human beings. And bioweapons, 5G and vaccines are the trifecta of mass death and tyranny that they’re using to accomplish their goal.I’ve put this into a must-see infographic shown below. It’s no accident the graphic is organized like the all-seeing eye and pyramid on the back of the US dollar. This is the structure of power over humanity that has been invoked by anti-human globalists for centuries.Take a look at the graphic here, and share everywhere, along with a warning. If humanity doesn’t rise up against our oppressors, we will be exterminated.To hear my full lecture on the death science trifecta, register at GenSix.com for the upcoming conference on May 15-16th. I’m presenting a nearly three-hour lecture on all this, detailing the real threats against humanity and how a small number of informed human beings may survive the extermination attempt.As you can see from the infographic above, depopulation is the end game of all this. Big Tech, Big Pharma and Big Science are all colluding to obliterate the human population on our planet. They are in, fact, preparing Earth for a post-human era.Here’s a preview snippet of what the lecture features:Globalists have decided they don’t need humans any longer, and their final act will be the global financial “reset” looting of all assets, combined with the global deployment of a vaccine euthanasia “kill switch” to cause billions of deaths. This is why they are now using armed government assault teams to raid and shut down anyone who promotes colloidal silver, vitamin C or chlorine dioxide, in order to eliminate any possibility of a nutrient or natural substance that might help protect the public from infections. They need to keep the path clear for vaccines to be the only “savior” of humanity. They can’t allow anything else to work first, you see. Vaccines must be the only option offered to the world.That’s the only way they can achieve widespread compliance with the euthanasia kill shots. They have to label them “vaccines” and tell people if they don’t take the shot, they won’t be allowed to participate in society. Big Tech is all part of this war on humanity, of course, as they are blacklisting all individuals or websites that dare to promote immune boosting strategies that might help protect humanity from a worsening pandemic.In essence, Big Tech, Big Pharma and Big Science have all become direct enemies of humanity, and they are engaged in a full-blown war on humanity, invoking (at least) three key weapons to destroy the human race: Biological weapons, electromagnetic weapons and chemical weapons.In truth, they’re also using pollution weapons (stratospheric aerosol injections /chemtrails), info weapons (engineered media disinformation) and genetic weapons (transgenetic weaponization of vaccine ingredients to alter the genetic code of vaccine recipients) too. At the same time, you may have noticed that the food supply is being deliberately destroyed in order to cause widespread famine and desperation. FEMA camps will offer soup kitchens and food bank “rescue” packages for the public, but as soon as the coronavirus vaccine is available, you’ll be required to show your “vaccine papers” to receive a food rescue package.Food scarcity, in other words, is being weaponized to force mandatory vaccines onto the public. When they are hungry enough, they will gladly line up to be injected with anything in exchange for a few meals. (And the globalists know this.) A mass awakening has begun… but will it emerge in time?Humanity is now on the brink. But there is also mass awakening taking place at this very moment, as billions of people around the world are coming to realize they are literally being enslaved with “house arrest” orders forced upon them by ignorant, incompetent, immoral “leaders” who refuse to recommend the nutritional solutions that can protect public health and help us all get back to normal living (things like zinc, vitamin D, vitamin C, elderberry extract and so on).Perhaps it will take the temporary experience of global enslavement to finally awaken humanity to the truth: You are a slave, Neo. You were born into a prison, a prison for your mind. And if you want to free your mind, you will need to reject the toxic chemicals, medicines, disinformation and technologies of the globalists. That means no 5G, no vaccines, no pharmaceuticals and no more living on processed junk food that makes you weak and dumbed down.Smash your iPhone. Put down the antidepressants. Turn off the brainwashing cable news. Stop eating garbage, nutrient-depleted processed food.Start filling your body with nutrition while energizing your mind with real, uncensored truth.",0
"On May 15-16th, as part of the True Legends “Ancient Cataclysms and Coming Catastrophes” online conference organized by Steve Quayle at GenSix.com, I will be presenting a nearly three-hour talk entitled, “The Depopulation Trifecta: Coronavirus, vaccines and 5G.”The two-day streaming event also features Bob Griswold, Derek Gilbert, Celeste Solum, L.A. Marzulli and many other gifted presenters and thought leaders.
The series focuses on dire catastrophes that humanity may be facing right now or in the near future.My own talk focuses on what I call the “trifecta” of assaults against humanity: The coronavirus, vaccines and 5G. These are indicative of biological weapons, chemical weapons and electromagnetic weapons, all formed and deployed against humanity in order to achieve the global depopulation that people like Bill Gates so desperately seek to achieve.Here’s an overview of the sections of my talk:The beliefs of the globalists: What they are trying to achieve through depopulation. (Hint: Planet Earth is being prepared for a post-human era.).How we are already in a biological war launched by globalists to destroy human freedom and exterminate most of the human population. The coronavirus attack wave is just the first of many to come.The three weapons of extermination: Bioweapons, vaccines and 5G – How they synergistically function to both enslave and exterminate the human race through electromagnetic weapons, chemical weapons and biological weapons, all without resorting to nuclear weapons that would pollute the planet for all life forms.The three layers of collapse: Debt (finance), Health and Cognition – how the collapse is being engineered at these three levels to attack the body, the mind and the spirit.How the information war against humanity is being waged with censorship of natural cures, independent journalism and pro-human information, where online information gatekeepers are actively pursuing an anti-human, anti-life agenda that ends with the mass extermination of most humans living today.Also in the presentation:How to survive the culling of the human race:Nutritional strategies to protect yourself from 5G exposure (and save your brain).Strategic relocation to evade the high population density targets such as US cities. How to make yourself resilient against the planned, engineered food supply collapse.How to preserve your wealth and assets to survive a global debt reset. How to protect your health from the multiple waves of bioweapons that will be released.Which hard assets to acquire that will be the most resilient against global geopolitical collapse.How globalists will seize control over the internet and block all traffic to sites they don’t want you to read.The “Fourth Turning” revolution that’s coming to the world as middle class workers grow tired of being looted by the elite.Streaming access is available at GenSix.com. A DVD set will is also available for pre-order. I am not compensated in any way for sales of streaming or DVDs, or anything else. I’m participating in this event out of respect for Steve Quayle’s mission to try to awaken humanity before it’s too late for us all.
Spread the word. This is going to be a must-see event to understand what we all face in the months ahead. Humanity has been targeted for termination, and most people have no clue what’s coming.",0
"As most people sit at home and patiently await their release from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns, reports continue to surface about potentially nefarious activities that are taking place under the cover of darkness while almost nobody is looking.One of these activities involves the alleged installation of 5G towers and biometrics systems at public schools, as well as inside and on top of other publicly funded facilities. Since many public outfits are temporarily shut down due to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), now is the perfect time for them to be outfitted with technologies that, were students and their parents present on a daily basis, would otherwise be much harder to conceal.Back in mid-March, the YouTube channel “Logic Before Authority” posted a video detailing a message purportedly received from a member of a local school board who claims that school districts are covertly installing 5G equipment in public schools while students remain at home indefinitely with their parents.

But upon closer analysis, this doesn’t appear to be true, at least not according to video footage that was captured of mysterious white work vans parked behind an unknown school.Although we do not see the name or location of the school, the video clearly shows vans for two companies – Systems Plus Wisconsin and North American Mechanical, Inc,” reports Global Research (Canada). “Both companies appear to be headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin.Systems Plus Wisconsin hangs up phone after being asked if their vans are associated with 5G installations
When the person who filmed all of the white vans at the school decided to contact the one company, Systems Plus Wisconsin, which admits that it installs biometrics systems, the person on the other end of the phone reportedly hung up when asked if there was anything happening in relation to 5G.The word 5G has almost become a dirty word, and something that even the companies that deal with it don’t want to be associated with anymore because of the negative stigma that’s attached to it. If you’d like to learn more about the dangers of 5G, be sure to check out the documentary film 5G Apocalypse: The Extinction Event.Since these two videos were published, many other inquisitive minds have checked out their local schools and observed similar activities. Mysterious vans installing unusual towers and antennas on school grounds during these lockdowns are apparently more common than previously thought, which is sparking a growing public backlash.Citizen journalists, if you will, are encouraged to get out there and take a look, and report what they find on social media, on YouTube, and even directly to their local school boards. Put the pressure where it needs to be and demand answers, otherwise this type of activity will only continue unquestioned.“Our concern is that 5G could be installed without our knowledge while we are grappling with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the installation of biometric systems could be a part of a more sinister agenda,” reports Global Research.",0
" Is 5G to partially blame for coronavirus deaths? Can 5G cause the blood that’s circulating in your body to be unable to carry oxygen?What’s especially horrifying about the critical care of coronavirus patients is that they aren’t suffering from “viral pneumonia,” but rather from an inability to absorb or carry oxygen in the blood.This has been confirmed by NYC ICU emergency physician Cameron Kyle-Sidell, who has released several videos detailing how coronavirus is not a kind of viral pneumonia. “We’re treating the wrong disease,” he says. And the ventilators are damaging the lungs of patients. He explains:COVID-19 lung disease, as far as I can see, is not a pneumonia and should not be treated as one. Rather, it appears as if some kind of viral-induced disease most resembling high altitude sickness. Is it as if tens of thousands of my fellow New Yorkers are on a plane at 30,000 feet at the cabin pressure is slowly being let out. These patients are slowly being starved of oxygen.Watch him explain how coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen starvation, not from a viral pneumonia lung infection:What this emergency room physician makes clear is that coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen deprivation, not a classic scenario of viral pneumonia. The patients’ lungs work fine, in other words, and the ventilators are actually damaging their lungs by forcing excessive pressure into them.How does blood transport oxygen in the first place?How, exactly, can all these patients be starved of oxygen when their lungs are technically working just fine? To understand one possible answer, you have to first understand how the blood carries oxygen. It’s way more fascinating than you might have supposed.When functioning normally, 1 molecule of hemoglobin binds with 4 molecules of oxygen, using iron (Fe2+), forming oxyhemoglobin. But this binding is only achieved because of something called “partial pressure” which means the concentration of oxygen in the lung tissues is higher than the concentration of oxygen on the hemoglobin molecule (roughly stated, this is simplified somewhat), so the oxygen “leaps” to the hemoglobin in order to equalize the partial pressures across the chasm.But 5G radiation alters the porosity of cell membranes, allowing some molecules or ionic elements to move more easily across those members, displacing other molecules (or soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide) that might normally make that leap. For example, it is well documented that 5G radiation causes “Voltage Gated Ion Channels” (VGIC), specifically with calcium ions (VGCC), causing cellular toxicity due to too much calcium entering the cell walls and poisoning the cells.The research on this was published in Environmental Research — here’s the link — and reveals that 5G exposure not only alters cell permeability (porosity), but also releases peroxinitrites in the body. These are inflammation-producing molecules that ravage other healthy molecules circulating in the blood.A thorough review of the available published science on wireless (WiFi) and electromagnetic frequency (EMF) exposure has identified at least seven different ways that WiFi and EMF microwave pollution actively harms the human body.Published in the journal Environmental Research, the peer-reviewed paper explains that exposure to WiFi signals, which are everywhere these days, can lead to: oxidative stress, sperm and testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG (electroencephalogram) changes, apoptosis (programmed cell death), cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, and calcium overload.Note that coronavirus patients are already being observed with neuropsychiatric effects, testicular damage and oxidative stress, three of the symptoms of 5G exposure.We just created this simple chart to point out the similarities between 5G exposure and coronavirus symptoms. Feel free to share everywhere, and link back to this article if possible:Mass insanity due to psychiatric effects of cellular poisoning. We also know that 5G radiation and its effects on the cells of the body can lead to symptoms of insanity, hallucinations and even powerful personality changes. Interestingly, CNN’s Chris Cuomo already described bouts of hallucinations as he was battling the coronavirus, living in a high-5G city (NYC). As I wrote on Natural News last December:5G radiation causes “neuropsychiatric” effects through a mechanism described as ion potentiation poisoning of brain cells, according to research published in Environmental Research.This results in behavioral changes and even personality changes among those who are routinely exposed, researchers found. In other words, 5G is a weapon system that doubles as a telecommunications infrastructure, but the real impact is to damage human brain function and destroy rationality, reason and civility, especially among those who live in high population cities where 5G towers are becoming ubiquitous. That’s why you may have noticed increased insanity and widespread mental derangement in those areas.Part of this effect may also be due to the production of peroxynitrites, which are generated in the body’s cells upon exposure to the voltage emitted by 5G radiation, which is beamed at your body in a narrow cone of high-intensity energy. (5G antennae focus energy in a tight beam that follows you around.) We are already observing the coronavirus causing psychiatric effects, including zombie-like violent, aggressive behavior such as deliberately spitting and coughing on people.How 5G radiation exposure alters the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen. Getting back to the oxygen question, the answer to why 5G radiation exposure may alter the function of hemoglobin is found in understanding the protein structure of hemoglobin itself.Hemoglobin relies on something called the “heme group” which is a complex molecule with iron (FE 2+) in its center. This is surrounded by something called a “porphyrin ring” which is a cluster of unique structures (made of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen) that has a special affinity for other oxygen atoms. The ability for oxygen to “leap” onto this molecule in the lungs depends entirely on the structure (which also implies the ionic charges) of these complex molecules.One thing to note in all this is that without the presence of histidine, a special protein, this heme group would have higher affinity toward carbon monoxide than oxygen, meaning the entire heme group would be occupied by carbon monoxide, blocking the absorption of oxygen. Thus, the histidine presence is critical for allowing the heme group to bind with oxygen. If you mess with histidine, you end up forcing hemoglobin to carry CO instead of O2, effectively creating oxygen deprivation in the blood.This heme group, by the way, has special affinity for carbon dioxide, which allows the same molecule to carry CO2 out of the body’s cells and transport CO2 back to the lungs. Remember: The same hemoglobin molecule must carry both CO2 and O2 but at different times, and it must attract and then release those molecules at opposite times in order to rid the body of CO2 and nourish the body with O2. This is all accomplished with a delicate balance of proteins and protein folding.The hemoglobin molecule itself is a miracle of nanotechnology. It transmorphs into two different structural states based on whether it’s carrying oxygen or not. In what’s called the “R-state,” this molecule is like a magnet for oxygen. When four oxygen atoms are bound, it becomes a highly stable structure (and appears red). Technically, the binding of a single molecule of oxygen (O2) increases the affinity toward oxygen on the three other oxygen sites, making the hemoglobin “mop up” four oxygen molecules very quickly. When it lacks oxygen, it changes to a “T-state” and appears blue, which is why low-oxygen blood has a blue color.The important thing to understand in all this is that any alteration of the delicate structure of hemoglobin will impair its ability to bind with oxygen.Take a look at the hemoglobin molecule representation above, from APSUbiology.org, and note the heme groups which are positioned in four places across the molecule. The polypeptide chains are part of the transmorphing structure of the molecule that allows it to carry and release both CO2 and O2, depending on the partial pressures of the gasses at different locations in the body (lungs vs. other cells). Note carefully that any change in the structure of hemoglobin will cause it to stop functioning:Increasing the permeability of the hemoglobin molecule — i.e. its affinity toward other soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide — will “occupy” the hemoglobin molecule with the wrong substances, making it unable to absorb oxygen because it is not presenting in its “R-state” by the time the heart pumps the blood back to the lungs.Stated another way, anything that significantly alters the affinity of hemoglobin toward other soluble gasses (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, or even ionic minerals in the blood) could “shut off” the ability of blood to carry oxygen by altering its atomic structure.If you change the structure of the heme group, it no longer functions to transport oxygen. Because in the case of the heme group, the structure is the function. Perhaps this can only be appreciated by organic chemists, but this heme group is truly a miracle of nanotechnology.Here’s a diagram of how iron, histidine, the heme group and O2 oxygen molecules interact with hemoglobin, which alters its structure depending on the “oxygenated” vs. “deoxygenated” forms. Can 5G exposure alter the structure of hemoglobin by increasing its affinity toward other molecules which are not O2?
The real question in all this is best phrased as I have asked it above. I doubt that we are dealing with a phenomenon where 5G radiation exposures blocks the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen, but rather occupies the hemoglobin molecule with other elements that alter its structure and therefore its function, inhibiting its ability to bind with oxygen.This is very likely happening all across the world wherever 5G is currently functioning, it’s just that the coronavirus is now exacerbating the symptoms and conditions to the point where mass death is occurring.In other words, the coronavirus pandemic would likely not be nearly as bad if 5G exposure / radiation pollution wasn’t already compromising the structure and function of hemoglobin cells in the bodies of people who live in 5G cities.This doesn’t mean the coronavirus isn’t real, of course; just that these two attacks on the human body have a synergistic effect of toxicity and mortality.Conclusion: Humanity is committing suicide with 5G.While I strongly disagree with those who are claiming there’s no such thing as a virus or that the coronavirus is a hoax, I do agree that the widespread deployment of 5G antennas is a kind of suicide pact for the world.Just as the Romans built their aqueducts out of lead linings and thereby poisoned their own citizens, driving them insane with load poisoning, the modern world of Big Tech and telecommunications is mass poisoning humanity with electropollution.Right now, a lot of people are talking about the book, “The Invisible Rainbow” by John Kaminski, who believes coronavirus is an “electrical disease” and that 5G alone is causing all the mass deaths, not the virus. He writes things like, “The flu is not contagious” and “the quarantine is all a terrible hoax.”Surely he is wrong on those claims, but he may not be wrong at all about the toxicity of electropollution and how 5G is actually a kind of “suicide system” that’s destroying humanity.
This all deserves a tremendous amount of additional study, but because we live in a world where Big Tech controls all the narratives and censors all those who question the safety of 5G, it now seems impossible for humanity to extricate itself from this mass suicide mission that has already been unleashed.
And that doesn’t even cover the topic of vaccines. What if Bill Gates’ vaccines are being deliberately engineered to contain toxic substances that 5G exposure will push into the cells, causing widespread death from “binary” exposure and subsequent cell toxicity?It sure would be a simple way for Bill Gates to achieve his global depopulation dreams, all while administering a global IQ test that finds out which people are stupid enough to line up and be injected with a euthanasia weapon system.Watch my video here on how we can end this pandemic and end the lockdowns, too, by turning to nutrition and masks:",0
"Scientists have been sounding the alarm about the dangers of 5th generation wireless technology. Some countries have heeded the warning about wireless radiation and the harmful effects of EMFs. China, on the other hand, has completely ignored all warnings and has proceeded to unleash 5G faster than any other nation. In fact, China rolled out 5G in the province of Wuhan in October 2019. Just two months later, the city became afflicted by a new kind of coronavirus named CoVid-19. How did a formerly benign class of virus become so opportunistic in such a short amount of time? Why is the death rate so high at the epicenter of the outbreak?Did the 5G launch in Wuhan China cause widespread compromised immune systems? Why did the city’s population suddenly become so vulnerable? Could it be that 5G oxidized important surveillance proteins of the innate immune system of the Wuhan population? Does 5G cause severe inflammation, damaging the innate immune system? Could it be that 5G does cause DNA breaks, as documented by scientists? Do these DNA breaks potentially affect innate immune molecules such as the mannose binding lectins (MBLs), which are primarily located on lung surfactant proteins A and D?MBLs are powerful defense molecules that have been clinically studied to target coronaviruses early in their replication cycle, preventing viral attachment. If MBL levels are compromised through oxidation, respiratory viruses can more readily take hold of the human host. Deficiency in MBLs also occurs when there is a three single point mutation in exon 1 of the MBL-2 gene. For an infectious agent to cause complication and/or fatality, a person’s immune system must be compromised. Did the launch of 5G in Wuhan China help facilitate the outbreak of this deadly bioweapon?MBLs are a natural defense system in the human body used for biological recognition and surveillance at the molecular level. MBLs bind with sugars, allowing the protein to interact with many different kinds of viruses, bacteria, yeasts, fungi and protozoa cloaked with such sugars. MBLs are unique because they can bind to the surface of microbes and activate the complement system in an antibody. They are one of the only anti-viral systems that can break down the signature glycoprotein shell that surrounds coronaviruses, including Ebola, SARS, and MERS.Deficiency in mannose binding lectins is linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neonatal sepsis, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), among other complications and respiratory illnesses. Scientists estimate that 10 to 30 percent of the population is deficient in MBLs, putting them at serious risk of complications from any and all respiratory infections. This is the most serious aspect of the coronavirus outbreak: Up to thirty percent of the population may already be susceptible to serious complications from this weaponized strain. 5G wireless radiation only compromises immunity further. After all, one of the documented symptoms of 5G is “flu-like symptoms.” Why is the fatality rate higher at the epicenter of the outbreak?Did the launch of 5G wireless radiation cause oxidative damage to innate immune molecules like the mannose binding lectins in the people of Wuhan China? Did 5G cause genetic mutations, suppressing natural levels of mannose binding lectins? Did the well documented oxidative effects of 5G affect the population’s innate immune system, oxidizing the very molecules that the immune system needs in order to protect the respiratory system? Is 5G accelerating the virility of coronavirus by weakening important cellular surveillance systems on the proteins of lung cells?",0
"Fears about 5G radiation towers inducing or exacerbating the symptoms associated with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) are driving some people to light the technology on fire in acts of protest.In Birmingham, England, for instance, a 5G mast that went up in flames the other day was captured on video as it burnt to a crisp. Similar burnings have also occurred in Liverpool, Melling, Merseyside and Aigburth, according to BBC News.It would seem as though folks are realizing, at least in Great Britain, that 5G is an existential threat to humanity, especially if it’s tied to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). And believe it or not, some evidence does exist to suggest that the millimeter wave radiation emitted from 5G towers actually opens up people’s cells to receive viruses, which would explain why Wuhan, China, which went live with 5G late last year, became the epicenter of the outbreak.As you’d probably expect, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other governmental authorities are saying this is all bogus, but people like singer and songwriter Keri Hilson believe that it’s all too correlative to simply be a coincidence.“Petitions, organizations, studies … what we’re going thru is the [e]ffects of radiation,” Hilson wrote on her Twitter account. “5G launched in CHINA.

But you have to admit that the timing of the 5G rollout combined with the sudden spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is at least suggestive of some type of connection between the two.Meanwhile, The Sun (UK) is saying that people targeting 5G towers for destruction are “idiots,” and that only “conspiracy nuts” believe that 5G has anything to do with the virus. The government of the United Kingdom (UK) has also come out to say that there is “no evidence to suggest that 5G has anything to do with Covid-19.”Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how Amazon is directly contributing to the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19):Is 5G at all connected to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19)?It’s worth noting that there’s also a connection between 5G and ID2020, the global microchipping and human tracking initiative that seeks to assign “digital identities” to every human being on earth.Microsoft co-founder and eugenicist Bill Gates is a big part of all this, especially as he seeks to vaccinate everyone in the world for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). As it turns out, the vaccines that Gates is proposing will come alongside “quantum dot tattoos” that will connect to and run off of 5G technology.
In other words, governments of the world are planning to eventually roll out a vaccine or two for the this coronvirus that people will have to accept if they want to be let out of quarantine. And these vaccines will come with microchips that are powered by 5G towers, which are being installed as an “essential” service even as people are locked down inside their homes.You can also check out this video in which a former executive at Vodafone, a major mobile phone carrier in the UK, blows the lid on the connection between 5G, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), the vaccine microchip agenda, and the move towards a global digital currency.",0
"China was the perfect playground for a lab-created virus to break containment. Sequencing of the virus shows that it was a manipulated strain, pieced together with virulent properties from SARS, MERS, and HIV. It doesn’t matter what the authorities say about its origin, whether it came from bats or the illegal animal markets in China; all the confusion and pandemonium began in China and has set the stage for authoritarians and sociopaths to deceive and take advantage of people throughout the world. China has at least a hundred million people in some form of lock down and Chinese citizens and healthcare workers are being censored or persecuted for speaking out about what’s happening.The virus has become a tool, an opportunity for authoritarians to seek control
Before Chinese authorities declared an outbreak, the country was experiencing widespread upheaval, with revolutionaries challenging the communist authorities in the city streets. The Chinese government needed a reason to clear the streets, to take complete control over the people with fear and force. China was fertile ground for an outbreak, for an oppressive government to take over, to round people up, but we’re all told to blame the virus.Heavily-polluted Chinese cities provide the perfect cover for the coronavirus narrative. Physicists from the University of California, Berkeley, calculated that 1.6 million people in China die each year from heart, lung and stroke problems caused by China’s heavily polluted air. This level of pollution has set the stage for wide scale weakness of heart, lung, and immune system health. China is fertile ground for an outbreak, as viruses can readily take advantage of immune-compromised populations. But we’re told to just blame the viru.Wuhan, the city where the outbreak was first declared, had previously unleashed 5G wireless technology one month before people began falling sick with “flu-like” illnesses. Wuhan, on its way to becoming a “smart city,” was one of the first cities to test out its new grid of millimeter wave microwave radiation. 5G has been banned in some cities because it can cause “flu-like” illnesses and has been documented as a source of chromosomal breaks in DNA, oxidative damage to cells, and much more. Wuhan was fertile ground for respiratory viruses to take advantage of the population, because many unknowing people were having their innate immune cells oxidized by an influx of wireless radiation. But we’re told to just blame the virus.
How long will the pandemonium of this virus continue and will the panic equally apply to other viruses in the future?How long will the pandemonium continue? Does anyone care that diagnostic tests are worthless for accurately defining coronavirus cases? Does anyone realize how easily case numbers can be inflated, driving hysteria through the news and into a community? Does anyone care that milder cases can be left out of the data, raising the death rate?How many people die annually from complications with the flu, pneumonia and sepsis? How many people around the world are suffering from vaccine-derived polio? What about typhus and hepatitis spreading in California? Why do children suffer from acute flaccid myelitis and RSV? In the future, will every fever and respiratory virus be treated with such authoritarian force and hysteria? Why are we supposed to fear this virus, more than all the others? It’s all about control.
The World Health Organization, praising China for its pandemic response, has inadvertently pressured governments around the world to take advantage of the pandemonium, to exert force and control. In America, the news media has broadcast nonstop fear, coaxing the federal government to respond in “heroic” fashion.
Trying to keep the markets from plummeting, the Trump administration has enacted the strictest quarantine measures in American history; it’s all a charade of protection because the immune-compromised American population are sitting ducks anyway. The Trump Administration is falling in line and giving the CDC over $8 billion to come up with a vaccine and to pump out new antiviral drugs that will inevitably resemble dangerous and ineffective Tamiflu. By the time the vaccine comes around, the number of coronavirus cases will inevitably have trickled down, like all historical incidences of infectious disease, but the vaccine will be heralded for saving humanity (like polio vaccines were).As the media tells us all to be afraid of a virus, governments and pharmaceutical companies are taking this as a great opportunity, an opportunity to control people, mentally and physically, and to exploit our faith, as everyone looks to them for the answers. The world need not fear a new novel coronavirus. The world should be wary of the loss of liberty and mobility that may result from this pandemonium: mandatory vaccine laws enacted by a fully-funded WHO and a paramilitary CDC. We should fear the invention of National IDs, driver’s licenses and/or passports that require everyone to submit to vaccines. We should be repulsed by the potential for roadside checkpoints and airports that could require vaccine administration and further testing of people’s body fluids. We should be wary that authoritarians will put cities and public events on lock down or how the military could be used to round people up or quarantine individuals over a fever. Because of the hysteria and pandemonium, we are slowly losing the freedom to congregate and the ability to travel abroad.These extreme measures will further convince people that the virus is dangerous, that we all need to secure order, but this authoritarian approach and its effects do not confirm that the virus is the problem or that those in charge are of goodwill.  The virus is an opportunity, a tool for sociopaths and authoritarians to exert mass control.",0
"While American Leftists and most of the Democrat Party continue to serve as apologists for the Chinese Communist regime over its role in creating and then perpetuating the coronavirus pandemic, a new U.S. government analysis concludes that COVID-19 “most likely” escaped from a lab near Wuhan city.
The Washington Times reports that the analysis cataloged evidence linking the outbreak to the Wuhan lab and has found that other explanations for the origins of the virus are not as credible. The paper reported:The document, compiled from open sources and not a finished product, says there is no smoking gun to blame the virus on either the Wuhan Institute of Virology or the Wuhan branch of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, both located in the city where the first outbreaks were reported.However, “there is circumstantial evidence to suggest such may be the case,” the paper says.“All other possible places of the virus’ origin have been proven to be highly unlikely,” said the report, a copy of which was obtained by the Times.ChiCom officials have claimed that the virus’ origin is unknown. However, Beijing initially stated that coronavirus came from animals at a “wet market” in Wuhan where exotic meats are butchered and sold in disgusting conditions. Chinese officials claim that COVID-19 went from bats to animals sold in the market last year, then infected humans. U.S. intelligence officials have increasingly dismissed that explanation, however, as attention has begun to focus on evidence suggesting that Chinese medical researchers were working with coronavirus in the country’s only Level 4 facility, which is in Wuhan. U.S. Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that intelligence agencies are investigating whether the virus escaped from a lab or was the result of a naturally occurring outbreak, but that analysts have ruled out reports that COVID-19 was manmade.‘The most logical place to investigate the virus origin has been completely sealed off’“At this point, it’s inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural,” the general said on April 14, “but we don’t know for certain.”The analysis said that the wet market explanation does not ring true because the first human diagnosis of coronavirus was made in someone who had no connection to the wet market in question. And according to Chinese reports, no bats were sold at that particular market.At the same time, several questionable actions and a growing paper trail provide clues that the virus actually escaped from a lab, even as China begins to clamp down on those information streams. (Related: Explosive new Health Ranger presentation streams live May 15 – 16: The Depopulation Trifecta: Coronavirus, vaccines and 5G.)“The most logical place to investigate the virus origin has been completely sealed off from outside inquiry by the CCP,” the document states, a reference to the Chinese Communist Party. “A gag order to both places was issued on Jan. 1, 2020, and a major general from the PLA who is China’s top military microbiologist essentially took over the [Wuhan Institute of Virology] since mid-January,” it says. Another lab is also under scrutiny by U.S. officials, the Times reported. Both have done extensive research on bat coronaviruses, including those similar to the molecular makeup of COVID-19.The Times adds: Among the most significant circumstantial evidence identified in the report are the activities of Shi Zhengli, a leader in bat coronavirus research with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, China’s only high-security, level four research laboratory.Ms. Shi has been involved in bioengineering bat coronaviruses, and a medical doctor named Wu Xiaohua launched an online campaign to expose Ms. Shi’s work.There are plenty of skeptics, however, most of them Democrats and Big Tech billionaires who are looking for any way they can to excuse China and blame the Trump administration for the pandemic.But the facts keep leading serious analysts back to China and, specifically, Wuhan city.",0
"One of President Donald Trump’s top coronavirus task force advisers, Dr. Anthony Fauci, backed funding for controversial coronavirus research at the lab now believed to have created COVID-19.Just last year the organization Fauci heads — the  National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases — “funded scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and other institutions for work on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses,” Newsweek reported.The news magazine added: In 2019, with the backing of NIAID, the National Institutes of Health committed $3.7 million over six years for research that included some gain-of-function work. The program followed another $3.7 million, 5-year project for collecting and studying bat coronaviruses,which ended in 2019, bringing the total to $7.4 million.
Many scientists have criticized gain of function research, which involves manipulating viruses in the lab to explore their potential for infecting humans, because it creates a risk of starting a pandemic from accidental release.SARS-CoV-2, which is the official name of the virus now sweeping the globe and killing tens of thousands of Americans, is thought to have originated in bats. In fact, after first claiming that the coronavirus had naturally evolved, U.S. intelligence officials now think that COVID-19 stemmed from an accidental leak at the lab in Wuhan city.At the same time, U.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that neither the Pentagon nor U.S. intelligence agencies believe the virus was manufactured because its genome sequence does not indicate that.“There’s a lot of rumor and speculation in a wide variety of media, blog sites, etc.,” Milley said last month. “It should be no surprise to you that we have taken a keen interest in that, and we have had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that.”Fauci promoted the work, arguing that the research was worth a risk
U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) was the first congressman to publicly suggest that the virus could have originated in a Chinese lab, though he was widely panned for it back in February.“We don’t know where it originated, and we have to get to the bottom of that,” he said in mid-April during an interview with Fox News. “We also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China’s only biosafety level 4 super laboratory that researches human infectious diseases.”
As for Fauci, he did not respond to a request for comment from Newsweek. However, a statement from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) noted, in part: “Most emerging human viruses come from wildlife, and these represent a significant threat to public health and biosecurity in the US and globally, as demonstrated by the SARS epidemic of 2002-03, and the current COVID-19 pandemic…. scientific research indicates that there is no evidence that suggests the virus was created in a laboratory.” (Related: Nearly half of severe coronavirus cases involve neurological complications.)The NIH’s research into coronavirus consisted of two parts, Newsweek noted. The first portion began in 2014 and involved surveillance of bat coronaviruses with a budget of $3.7 million.That program funded Shi Zheng-Li, a Wuhan lab virologist, as well as other researchers who were investigating and cataloguing bat coronaviruses in the wild. 
This portion of the project was completed last year, the news magazine said.“A second phase of the project, beginning that year, included additional surveillance work but also gain-of-function research for the purpose of understanding how bat coronaviruses could mutate to attack humans,” Newsweek said. Roughly 10 years ago during a controversial gain-of-function research project on bird-flu viruses, Fauci promoted the work, arguing that the research was worth a risk because it involved scientists making preparations that could be helpful during a pandemic.

"During a recent episode of the Thomas Paine Podcast, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. blew the lid on Dr. Anthony Fauci’s extensive legacy of fraud and coverups throughout his lengthy medical career in the federal government.Kennedy explained that Fauci has been a problematic character all throughout his more than 50-year tenure in public health, during which he operated as a workplace tyrant and ruined the careers of countless physicians and researchers who, unlike himself, were upstanding and honorable individuals.Fauci has been with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984 – can you say deep state? – and he’s known among those on the inside as the guy who “poisoned an entire generation of Americans,” according to Kennedy.In at least one instance, Fauci targeted a whistleblower who was trying to expose the fact that America’s blood supply is tainted with deadly disease strains. Fauci ruined the career of this physician and proceeded to cover up his crucial research on the subject.Kennedy also warned during the program that Fauci has attacked many other good guys who’ve tried to actually serve the public rather than shill for Big Pharma, Bill Gates, the mainstream media and other deep state assets and mouthpieces of deception and lies.The entire Thomas Paine Podcast episode, which is a little more than two-and-a-half hours long, is available at this link.Also, be sure to check out the following episode of The Health Ranger Report in which Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how globalists like Anthony Fauci are using the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis to test how much tyranny Americans are willing to accept:Anthony Fauci owns “many, many” patents on vaccines, warns Kennedy.Fauci is also guilty of abusing his post for financial gain in the form of obtaining lucrative vaccine patents. Doctors and researchers underneath him who developed breakthrough technologies have been fired so that Fauci could assume ownership of their work in order to enrich himself.“Tony Fauci has many, many vaccine patents,” Kennedy contends, noting that Fauci now owns a patent on a special protein sheet made from HIV that helps to more efficiently deliver vaccine material throughout the body. Fauci didn’t develop this protein sheet himself, of course, but rather stole it from someone else who was relieved from duty after creating it.“Tony Fauci fired [this person] and he somehow ended up owning that patent,” Kennedy says. “And that patent is now being used by some of these companies … to make vaccines for the coronavirus … that company has a 50/50 split with Tony Fauci’s agency … so Fauci’s agency will collect half the royalties on that vaccine and there’s no limit for how much the agency can collect.”In other words, this is nothing but a business for people like Fauci, who are profiting off of pandemics like the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) while claiming to be “regulating” the drug and vaccine industries that respond to them on behalf of the American people.
“This isn’t a captured industry; it’s a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical industry,” Kennedy further warns about how the NIAID, the CDC, and other supposed federal agencies are really just corporations in disguise that work on behalf of Big Pharma to generate massive profits on the backs of sick and dying people.You’ll want to listen to the full podcast in its entirety, or at least the second hour-and-a-half of it featuring Robert F. Kennedy Jr., because it’s a real eye-opener. A second source for listening to the podcast, in case the first one doesn’t work, is available at this link.",0
"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. revealed disturbing information about Dr. Anthony Fauci’s medical career in the government, calling out the celebrated physician for a history of disturbing practices ranging from costly cover ups to outright fraud.Kennedy repeatedly slammed Fauci on the Thomas Paine Podcast on Wednesday, revealing disturbing information about Fauci’s problematic career steering key medical policy for the United States. Kennedy described Fauci as a workplace tyrant who has ruined careers of upstanding physicians and researchers in order to cover up scandals and costly medical research disasters at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases where Fauci has served as a director since 1984 as part of the National Institute of Health.“Tony Fauci didn’t want the American public to know that he has poisoned an entire generation of Americans,” Kennedy said, alleging Fauci targeted a whistleblower who was trying to uncover the blood supply in the country was tainted with deadly strains. Kenney said Fauci ruined the physician’s career and covered up the crucial research. And that was just one of Kennedy’s attacks against Fauci. There were more. Kennedy also targeted Bill Gates, Big Pharma, the media, and more in this exclusive interview. Listen below.",0
"If you are one of the millions of Americans wondering why Dr. Anthony Fauci is vehemently cheerleading and praising a coronavirus vaccine for ALL Americans … Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says follow the money.Bobby Kennedy Jr. dropped a bombshell on the Thomas Paine Podcast, detailing an apparent agreement between the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Bill Gates-backed pharmacuetical company that has the best chance at this point of securing lucrative contracts for a national coronavirus vaccine. That puts your government in bed with Big Pharma and Gates and could pay as much as 50 percent of the profits to the NIH, the parent agency that employs Dr. Anthony Fauci — who again — is lobbying for the vaccine. Does Fauci get a cut of the bounty too? Or has he already been cut in?Federal officials are not commenting on Kennedy’s alarming information. But … the NIH is the key player in deciding what vaccines get approved for coronavirus and the NIH and government would profit wildly, as Kennedy said, if the Gates-backed pharma play Moderna Inc. gets the green light. Kennedy slammed both Gates and Fauci on numerous occasions during the exclusive interview with Paine. Gates’ company is already in human trials with the vaccine. Just weeks after the outbreak? ",0
 DISTURBING Details of Threats,0
"Back in 2015 the NIH under the direction of Dr. Tony Fauci gave a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is now the main suspect in leaking the coronavirus that has killed more than 50,000 Americans and, thanks to Dr. Fauci again, destroyed the US economy.As early as 2018 US State Department officials warned about safety risks at the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab on scientists conducting risky tests with the bat coronavirus. US officials made several trips to the Wuhan laboratory.Despite the warnings the US National Institute of Health (NIH) awarded a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan lab studying the bat virus.  This was after State Department warned about the risky tests going on in the lab.This is unbelievable!
The deadly China coronavirus that started in China sometime in late 2019 has now circled the globe.  Evidence suggests that the coronavirus didn’t come naturally.  We still don’t know whether the deadly virus was leaked intentionally or if it was an accident. But we do know that the Chinese did attempt to market a cure for the coronavirus to the world in January after the virus began to spread.According to the report from Wuhan the coronavirus came from either the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention or Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China. These reports linking bats to the coronavirus started making the rounds back in January. A research paper published in the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention determined the source of the coronavirus is a laboratory near the Seafood Market in Wuhan.On Sunday Rudy Giuliani dropped a bomb on Dr. Fauci. Rudy scolded the NIAID Director of granting $3.7 million to the Wuhan lab that leaked the coronavirus. And then Rudy accused the NIH of knowing more than they are leading on.Rudy Giuliani questioned Dr. Anthony Fauci’s involvement in grants from the United States to a laboratory in Wuhan, China, that has been tied to the coronavirus pandemic.According to a report, the U.S. Intelligence Community has growing confidence that the current coronavirus strain may have accidentally escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology rather than from a wildlife market, as the Chinese Communist Party first claimed. During a Sunday interview on The Cats Roundtable, Giuliani questioned why the U.S. gave money to the lab.“Back in 2014, the Obama administration prohibited the U.S. from giving money to any laboratory, including in the U.S., that was fooling around with these viruses. Prohibited! Despite that, Dr. Fauci gave $3.7 million to the Wuhan laboratory — even after the State Department issued reports about how unsafe that laboratory was, and how suspicious they were in the way they were developing a virus that could be transmitted to humans,” he claimed.He added, “We never pulled that money. Something here is going on, John. I don’t want to make any accusations. But there was more knowledge about what was going on in China with our scientific people than they disclosed to us when this first came out. Just think of it: If this laboratory turns out to be the place where the virus came from, then we paid for it. We paid for the damn virus that’s killing us.”",0

During a Sunday interview on The Cats Roundtable, Giuliani questioned why the U.S. gave money to the lab.""Back in 2014, the Obama administration prohibited the U.S. from giving any money to any laboratory, including in the U.S., that was fooling around with these viruses. Prohibited! Despite that, Dr. Fauci gave $3.7 million to the Wuhan laboratory — and then even after the State Department issued reports about how unsafe that laboratory was, and how suspicious they were in the way they were developing a virus that could be transmitted to humans,"" he claimed.
He added, ""We never pulled that money. So, something here is going on, John. I don’t want to make any accusations. But there was more knowledge about what was going on in China with our scientific people than they disclosed to us when this first came out. Just think of it: If this laboratory turns out to be the place where the virus came from, we paid for it. We paid for the damn virus that’s killing us.”While Giuliani placed the blame on Fauci, who has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, it is not clear what oversight he had in the funding decisions. The NIAID did award $3.7 million in grants to EcoHealth Alliance to study the “risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China"" at wet markets, but not all of that funding went to the lab in Wuhan.
President Trump has been asked about the matter and blamed the Obama administration for the donation, saying, ""Who is president then, I wonder?"" However, the funding was approved from 2014 to 2019, including $700,000 that was awarded under the Trump administration.Giuliani called for an investigation into the Wuhan laboratory, saying, ""Today, if I were U.S. attorney, I’d open an investigation into the Wuhan laboratory. And I’d want to know, what did we know? How much did we know about how bad the practices were there? Who knew about it? And who sent them money anyway? And that person would sure as heck be in front of a grand jury trying to explain to me — what are you asleep?”",0
"The National Institutes of Health has given millions of dollars to scientists studying coronaviruses. That funding didn't cause the COVID-19 pandemic.Right-wing media and conspiracy theorists have seized on a series of grants awarded over the course of six years to study coronaviruses to undermine Dr. Anthony Fauci, the immunologist who’s been at the helm of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. The narrative moved to the spotlight at the White House when, during a press conference on April 17, a reporter with Newsmax asked President Donald Trump about the grants, totaling $3.7 million since 2014.The Daily Mail, a British tabloid known for publishing unreliable stories, first reported the $3.7 million figure on April 11. The paper wrote a story on the funding, parts of which went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. Although the article stated that there’s no evidence the novel coronavirus leaked from the lab, it implied a correlation between the grants and the pandemic: ""The revelation that the Wuhan Institute was experimenting on bats from the area already known to be the source of COVID-19 — and doing so with American money — has sparked further fears that the lab, and not the market, is the original outbreak source.""Those questions have had real effects. Politico reported on April 27 that the National Institutes of Health would be revoking grants given to New York–based nonprofit organization EcoHealth Alliance in 2019, including funds for 2020 that the nonprofit now has to return.But in reality, the grants appear to have nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, they were awarded after a different kind of coronavirus — SARS — spread across the world in 2003. The NIH also didn’t give the funds directly to the Wuhan Institute, instead awarding them to EcoHealth Alliance, which invests in health research globally. The money helped support research that led to 20 research papers on coronaviruses published over the six years, according to the NIH. It’s not clear whether Fauci was personally involved in the grants in any way.Aside from the Wuhan Institute, those funds also went to research facilities in Shanghai, Beijing, and Singapore. The grants were meant to “support research that aims to understand what factors allow coronaviruses, including close relatives to SARS, to evolve and jump into the human population and cause disease (called a spillover event),” an NIH spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.“Most emerging human viruses come from wildlife, and these represent a significant threat to public health and biosecurity in the US and globally, as demonstrated by the SARS epidemic of 2002–03, and the current COVID-19 pandemic,” the spokesperson said. “The project includes studying viral diversity in animal (bats) reservoirs, surveying people that live in high-risk communities for evidence of bat-coronavirus infection, and conducting laboratory experiments to analyze and predict which newly discovered viruses pose the greatest threat to human health.”The grant also wasn’t the first awarded to EcoHealth Alliance. The NIH has been funding infectious disease research projects through the nonprofit since 2005.
But the Daily Mail failed to note that context, as did the Newsmax reporter, who on April 17 asked Trump: ""There was also another report [saying] that the NIH under the Obama administration in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the US give a grant like that to China?”Newsmax reporter Emerald Robinson did not return a request for comment.For Joan Donovan, the director of the Technology and Social Change Project at Harvard's Shorenstein Center, the attacks and conspiracies are part of a larger narrative undermining Fauci and his work. “If you don’t trust the scientist, you don’t trust the science,” Donovan said.And the right-wing media and conspiratorial YouTube channels have used the grants to stoke that distrust.On April 26, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani called for an investigation of the grant on a New York morning radio show. 0ly and without evidence, the former mayor of New York implied the virus was created as a biological weapon, blaming Fauci and the administration of President Barack Obama.“China for the last 10 to 12 years has been carrying on these experiments, including in this Wuhan laboratory, with animals, and actually making this virus more dangerous,” Giuliani said on the show. “You could say that’s for scientific purposes, or you could say that’s for the purpose of weaponizing them.”“'Paid for the Damn Virus That’s Killing Us': Giuliani Rips Fauci Over Grants to Wuhan Laboratory,” said a Washington Examiner headline on April 26, gathering over 150,000 Facebook likes, shares, and comments.“Anthony Fauci Should Explain '$3.7 Million to the Wuhan Laboratory'” read a headline in the Washington Times on April 27, which received over 165,000 Facebook likes, shares, and comments.Rep. Matt Gaetz and Newsweek may have also perpetuated the 0ly shaded narrative, but the most popular piece of content about the grants came from the Next News Network, a YouTube channel known for circulating baseless claims, including a fabricated story about President Bill Clinton sexually assaulting a teenager. Hosted by commentator and conspiracy theorist Gary Franchi, the channel has over a million subscribers and surpassed a billion views in December, according to Forbes.On April 19, the Next News Network posted a video about the grants, which has received over 2.3 million views. In it, osteopath Rashid Buttar drew a direct line between the grant, Fauci, and the pandemic. According to YouTube, the video did not violate the social media company's policies.“Is Fauci directly responsible for this pandemic?” Franchi asked Buttar in the clip.“I’m going to say this: I’ve seen some petitions going around."" Buttar responded. “I think he’s a criminal. He’s going against the law. He’s going against the government.”Franchi told BuzzFeed News he was asking Buttar ""to clarify his belief that Dr. Fauci’s work with coronaviruses has led to the pandemic.”He added: “The video as a whole revolves around President Trump responding to a reporter that he is investigating the widely reported 3.7 million dollars sent to the Wuhan Lab in 2015 by the NIH to continue coronavirus research after a moratorium was placed on such research in the United States and Dr. Fauci’s involvement with the funding of that research.”In addition to spreading conspiracy theories about the pandemic, Buttar has a history of action taken against him by medical authorities. In 2010, the North Carolina medical board reprimanded him for, among other complaints, three cancer patients who sought treatment from him and paid for treatment that had “no known value for the treatment of cancer.”“Buttar has spent years selling skin drops at $150 a bottle as a treatment for diseases ranging from autism to cancer,” WCNC reported at the time.In 2013, the FDA sent Buttar a warning letter for promoting and distributing unapproved medical products on his websites and Buttar did not respond to a request for comment on his statements about Dr. Fauci.""The medical board and FDA have a responsibility to make sure doctors don't push too close to the edge,"" he said in an emailed statement to BuzzFeed News. ""The regulatory bodies serve an important function and are needed to safeguard the public.""",1
"Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) said this weekend that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would rather investigate President Donald Trump again than focus on the actual origins of the Chinese coronavirus and U.S. tax dollars that went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology from which intelligence officials increasingly believe the virus leaked.Appearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, Reschenthaler discussed his efforts to investigate tax dollars that flowed through a New York firm to the Wuhan lab. He said that Pelosi and House Democrats are not interested in holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable and, instead, want to focus their oversight efforts on politically harming President Trump again just like they tried and failed with the partisan impeachment last year and earlier this year.“We should have an investigative body looking at these grants, but Nancy Pelosi is not going to do that,” Reschenthaler said. “So you have myself and House Republicans. I can tell you I’m going to continue to look into these grants. I’m going to continue to look into the Department of Homeland Security as well to see what grants are going from there to China. I’m also looking at defunding the World Health Organization and we can talk about that as well. But the bottom line of the Democrats’ behavior is this: They hate this president so badly that they would rather side with the Chinese Communist Party than defend Americans and defend our spending and spend wisely and just be honest. That is their hatred for President Trump and disdain for President Trump’s supporters.”Reschenthaler wrote a letter this week to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper inquiring about a Pentagon grant to EcoHealth Alliance, Inc., a New York firm that has had a history of funding the Wuhan Institute of Virology with subgrants from American taxpayers. The Pentagon grant the congressman was inquiring about was for research into bat-borne zoonotic diseases and their potential as weapons of mass destruction or biological weapons. While it is unclear if that grant saw U.S. taxpayer money flowing from it out to the Wuhan lab, it is known that another grant that EcoHealth Alliance received did partially spend U.S. tax dollars in the Chinese lab.That grant, from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — in particular the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is run by the now-famous Dr. Anthony Fauci — saw U.S. tax dollars sent to EcoHealth Alliance for researching coronaviruses from bats flow out to the Chinese lab in Wuhan. Some of the money went to other labs around the world too, an NIH official confirmed to Breitbart News last week. But the NIH was so concerned about the money and this lab in Wuhan that the government notified EcoHealth Alliance that it would be investigating the matter and that any funds to the Wuhan lab must be halted while the investigation occurred.The NIH funded EcoHealth Alliance, which then, in turn, turned around and partially funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” Reschenthaler told Breitbart News. “The DOD also gave EcoHealth Alliance $6.5 million in a grant, and like you said, that grant was to understand bat-borne zoonotic disease in context with weapons of mass destruction. So what I’m trying to find out is whether or not the DOD funding that went to EcoHealth also went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We know that the NIH funding did, and we also know that all money is fungible, but I want to see if we can trace that money to Wuhan to see how much and to what extent the DOD and American taxpayers actually funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology.",0
"President Donald Trump said Friday he will end federal funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology that some are claiming spawned the coronavirus. At the daily coronavirus task force news conference, the president was asked why the National Institutes of Health would include the Chinese laboratory in a $3.7 million dollar stipend to conduct research.“The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million. I’ve been hearing about that. We’ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area, we are looking at it literally about an hour ago and also early in the morning,” Trump said. “We will end the grant very quickly. It was granted quite a while ago. They were granted a substantial amount of money. We are going to look at it and take a look. But I understand it was a number of years ago. When did you hear the grant was made?” The reporter informed the president that the funding was from 2015. Trump noted the date and asked, “2015. Who was president then? I wonder.”Republican Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz raised the issue of the funding earlier this week during an appearance on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” “I’m against funding Chinese research in our country, but I’m sure against funding it in China. The NIH gives this $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they then advertise that they need coronavirus researchers and following that coronavirus erupts in Wuhan,” Gaetz explained.On Friday, Gaetz tweeted his gratitude to Trump and Health Secretary Alex Azar:  “Thank you President @realDonaldTrump and @SecAzar for committing to end this America Last grant given to labs in Wuhan by the Obama Administration!”Reports claiming that the COVID-19 virus originated in the Wuhan lab and was released to the local community have gained traction in the last week.",0
"Back in 2015 the NIH under the direction of Dr. Tony Fauci gave a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The Wuhan Institute of Virology is now the main suspect in leaking the coronavirus that has killed more than 50,000 Americans and, thanks to Dr. Fauci again, destroyed the US economy.As early as 2018 US State Department officials warned about safety risks at the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab on scientists conducting risky tests with the bat coronavirus.US officials made several trips to the Wuhan laboratory.Despite the warnings, the US National Institute of Health (NIH) awarded a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan lab studying the bat virus.  This was after State Department warned about the risky tests going on in the lab.The deadly China coronavirus that started in China sometime in late 2019 has now circled the globe.  Evidence suggests that the coronavirus didn’t come naturally.  We still don’t know whether the deadly virus was leaked intentionally or if it was an accident. But we do know that the Chinese did attempt to market a cure for the coronavirus to the world in January after the virus began to spread.According to the report from Wuhan the coronavirus came from either the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention or Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China. These reports linking bats to the coronavirus started making the rounds back in January. A research paper published in the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention determined the source of the coronavirus is a laboratory near the Seafood Market in Wuhan.On Sunday Rudy Giuliani dropped a bomb on Dr. Fauci. Rudy scolded the NIAID Director of granting $3.7 million to the Wuhan lab that leaked the coronavirus. And then Rudy accused the NIH of knowing more about this than they are leading on to.Rudy Giuliani questioned Dr. Anthony Fauci’s involvement in grants from the United States to a laboratory in Wuhan, China, that has been tied to the coronavirus pandemic.According to a report, the U.S. Intelligence Community has growing confidence that the current coronavirus strain may have accidentally escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology rather than from a wildlife market, as the Chinese Communist Party first claimed.

Prohibited! Despite that, Dr. Fauci gave $3.7 million to the Wuhan laboratory — even after the State Department issued reports about how unsafe that laboratory was, and how suspicious they were in the way they were developing a virus that could be transmitted to humans,” he claimed.Rudy Giuliani later dropped this bomb on the grant to the Wuhan lab — Did Obama sign off on this?",0
"But just last year, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the organization led by Dr. Fauci, funded scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and other institutions for working on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses.In 2019, with the backing of NIAID, the National Institutes of Health committed $3.7 million over six years for research that included some gain-of-function work. The program followed another $3.7 million, 5- year project for collecting and studying bat coronaviruses, which ended in 2019, bringing the total to $7.4 million. Many scientists have criticized the gain of function research, which involves manipulating viruses in the lab to explore their potential for infecting humans because it creates a risk of starting a pandemic from accidental release.The NIH research consisted of two parts. The first part began in 2014 and involved surveillance of bat coronaviruses, and had a budget of $3.7 million. The program funded Shi Zheng-Li, a virologist at the Wuhan lab, and other researchers to investigate and catalog bat coronaviruses in the wild. This part of the project was completed in 2019.A second phase of the project, beginning that year, included additional surveillance work but also gain-of-function research for the purpose of understanding how bat coronaviruses could mutate to attack humans. NIH canceled the project just this past Friday, April 24th.A decade ago, during a controversy over gain-of-function research on bird-flu viruses, Dr. Fauci played an important role in promoting the work. He argued that the research was worth the risk it entailed because it enables scientists to make preparations, such as investigating possible anti-viral medications, that could be useful if and when a pandemic occurred. The work in question was a type of gain-of-function research that involved taking wild viruses and passing them through live animals until they mutate into a form that could pose a pandemic threat.The work entailed risks that worried even seasoned researchers. More than 200 scientists called for the work to be halted. The problem, they said, is that it increased the likelihood that a pandemic would occur through a laboratory accident. in 2014, under pressure from the Obama administration, the National of Institutes of Health instituted a moratorium on the work, suspending 21 studies. Three years later, though—in December 2017—the NIH ended the moratorium and the second phase of the NIAID project, which included the gain-of-function research, began. ",0
"It is clear now that the so-called experts at the IHME and CDC utterly failed in their ever-changing models and predictions on the coronavirus.
In fact, they were off by a month on the first COVID-19 deaths in the US and OFF BY MILLIONS in their models that explain the breadth of the disease in the US.
This impacted their decisions on how to confront the coronavirus pandemic in the United States.The current draconian measures to battle this flu-like virus were pushed by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx when they marched into the Oval Office and warned President Trump that he must lock down the economy for weeks to confront this invisible monster… And they did this based on wildly inaccurate models and predictions!
Fauci and Birx told President Trump 1.5 to 2.2 million Americans would die if he did not shut down the economy.
They were off by MILLIONS! And now we know where Fauci and Birx got their plans to lockdown and destroy the US economy.
From the WHO.Dr. Ned Nikolov discovered it was the World Health Organization (WHO) that proposed the lockdown rules for pandemics.This is the same organization that misled the global community for weeks while the coronavirus spread throughout China and beyond.Dr. Nikolov asks:  Why did WHO recommend/push Governments to lock down their countries when there was NO convincing evidence that such a draconian social-distancing measure would work and while they KNEW that the economic consequences of a shutdown would be severe?The WHO updated its pandemic rules in 2019 — before the coronavirus. Today the global community is facing a certain economic depression thanks to these lock-down rules.And Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx pushed this plan on President Trump and the US, based on faulty models and corrupt WHO regulations!",0

Independent labs found a sterility formula in every vaccine tested. After denying the charges, WHO finally admitted it had been developing the sterility vaccines for over a decade.

Approximately 1,200 suffered severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders. Seven died. Indian government investigations charged that Gates-funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls. The case is now in the country’s Supreme Court.A 2017 study (Morgenson et. al. 2017) showed that WHO’s popular DTP vaccine is killing more African children than the diseases it prevents.

WHO has refused to recall the lethal vaccine which it forces upon tens of millions of African children annually.Global public health advocates around the world accuse Gates of steering WHO’s agenda away from the projects that are proven to curb infectious diseases: clean water, hygiene, nutrition, and economic development.The Gates Foundation only spends about $650 million of its $5 billion dollar budget on these areas. They say he has diverted agency resources to serve his personal philosophy that good health only comes in a syringe.In addition to using his philanthropy to control WHO, UNICEF, GAVI, and PATH, Gates funds a private pharmaceutical company that manufactures vaccines, and additionally is donating $50 million to 12 pharmaceutical companies to speed up development of a coronavirus vaccine.In his recent media appearances, Gates appears confident that the Covid-19 crisis will now give him the opportunity to force his dictatorial vaccine programs on American children.",0
 Fauci “Poisoned an Entire Generation of Americans”,0
"In lockstep with Mr. Microsoft (Bill Gates) himself, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) head Dr. Anthony Fauci has signaled that Americans will eventually be able to return back to normal after the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis ends. But this will probably only be the case if they agree to get vaccinated and carry around digital proof of vaccination everywhere they go.Speaking on CNN‘s “New Day” program, Fauci stated that requiring digital vaccine certificates is a “possible” outcome of the pandemic because “it’s one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not.”“This is something that’s being discussed,” he added. “I think it might actually have some merit.”Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican, has similarly proposed that the government create some type of immune registry to keep track of people who are no longer believed to be at risk of infection with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). One possible way to do this is to administer antibody testing, which could potentially indicate whether or not someone has already had the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and is now recovered and immune to it.Very soon, Fauci says, there will be a “rather large number” of tests available for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). But a potential problem will be validating them as accurate, seeing as how early Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) tests were wildly inaccurate.“It’s very likely that there are a large number of people out there that have been infected, have been asymptomatic, and did not know they were infected,” Fauci admitted. “If their antibody test is positive, one can formulate kind of strategies about whether or not they would be at risk or vulnerable to get infected.”Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how food riots could begin as soon as May if the lockdowns across our country don’t come to an end very soon:Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci want to force the mark of the beast on you in the name of stopping coronavirus. Fauci’s buddy Gates has a similar plan in mind that involves giving people a digital mark of the beast that “approves” them for reentry back into society once they’ve been deemed “safe” following mandatory vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).Gates has stated that he would like to see everyone have a “quantum dot tattoo” microchip inserted into their bodies that would not only “clear” them of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), but also function as a digital form of identification (ID2020) that includes the entirety of a person’s medical records.
Even though simple zinc is already proving to be a viable “cure” for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) – no vaccines required – the world’s most outspoken eugenicist at the current time is insistent upon vaccinating the entire globe against this virus in order to keep everyone “safe” from any diseases it might cause.
“The corporate elite that runs things behind the scenes has turned an illness no more. dangerous than the common flu into a pretext for an enormous expansion of government power and an enormous transfer of money from the citizens to the corporate elite,” wrote one Washington Times commenter in response to this news.“Most people still believe – despite so much evidence to the contrary – that the government and the corporate media do not lie, especially about the big things. In reality, the government and the corporate media lie about everything – especially about the big things.”",0
"Anthony Fauci: He’s a bit on the short side, seemingly always has this creepy joker grin on his face, and wants you and your family to be forcibly vaccinated against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) before you’ll ever again be allowed to leave your house for anything other than cattle pen grocery shopping.
One of the nation’s most hated deep state tool bags at this point, Fauci exposes himself as a wolf in sheep’s clothing just a little bit more with each passing day. And now that we know the guy works for Bill Gates and Big Pharma, the cat is pretty much out of the bag as to his true intentions – but are enough people paying attention?While feigning expertise in the area of virology, Fauci continues to use his platform to push a vaccine on the public that doesn’t even yet exist. Fauci is also vehemently opposed to all other potential treatment options, including inexpensive remedies that already exist and are being used elsewhere in the world with notable success.Fauci would seem to have a vested interest in seeing a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine not only come to fruition but be the only medical treatment option available to Americans, even though success against the pandemic is already being seen with hydroxychloroquine, for instance, a malaria drug that costs just a few cents per dose.Fauci is so determined to get a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine launched and spread across the country as quickly as possible that he’s actually now threatening to never let anyone out of their houses ever again unless they agree to get jabbed in accordance with his desires.“When we get back to normal, we will go back to the point where we can function as a society,” Fauci recently stated.But … [i]f you want to get back to pre-coronavirus, that might not ever happen in the sense that the threat is there. But I believe that with the therapies that will be coming online, and the fact that I feel confident that over a period of time we will get a good vaccine, that we will never have to get back to where we are right now.”Be sure to listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how we need a national zinc campaign to raise awareness about how this natural mineral can help to stop the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and end the lockdowns:Fauci is on the Leadership Council of the Gates Foundation’s “Decade of Vaccines” Global Vaccine Action Plan As it turns out, Fauci quietly sits on the Leadership Council of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Vaccine Action Plan, which is currently reaching the finality of its so-called “Decade of Vaccines” initiative that began in 2010. This fully explains why he’s gone all-in for a future Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, and why he’s signaled that Americans will continue to be held hostage until they agree to get it.Like Gates, Fauci stands to make millions from the release of a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, which seems to have been the agenda all along. He probably wasn’t expecting President Trump to ever make any mention of hydroxychloroquine, nor did he anticipate anything other than full compliance from the American people, who’ve been scared to death by this social engineering experiment, also known as 9/11 2.0.But Fauci’s cover has been blown, and everyone who’s paying attention can now see him for the rat he is. The guy only cares about forcing a vaccine on you and couldn’t care less whether you live or die in the process, just like his buddy Bill Gates.",0
"Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) task force head Dr. Anthony Fauci doesn’t want Americans taking hydroxychloroquine, or chloroquine, to treat the virus, and many people are wondering why not?One of them is White House economic advisor Peter Navarro, who reportedly exploded at Fauci the other day for trying to downplay the benefits of this extremely inexpensive generic drug for malaria, while emphasizing the alleged superiority of some future vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that doesn’t even exist yet.Even though hydroxychloroquine is shaping up to be the most effective weapon in the arsenal – at least from a pharmaceutical perspective – for treating this coronavirus, Fauci isn’t having any of it. And that’s because, as he’s now proven, he works for Big Vaccine and not for the American people.
During a recent roundtable, which was reportedly attended by Wuhan coronvirus (COVID-19) response coordinator Deborah Birx, Jared Kushner, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acting commissioner Stephen Hahn, Navarro passed out folders containing data on the benefits of hydroxychloroquine.According to Navarro and what he passed out, the studies he’s seen, mostly from overseas, show that this malaria drug shows “clear therapeutic efficacy” against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and it can be procured for just pennies per dose.Almost immediately, Fauci began pushing back against Navarro’s claims, stating that “there’s only anecdotal evidence” that hydroxychloroquine works against COVID-19. This “just set Peter off,” according to one of the others who was present, prompting Navarro to explain that “science, not anecdote” shows that hydroxychloroquine does, in fact, work against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks to Dr. Eduard Fatakhov about how to beat the coronavirus through nutrition:Navarro also called out Fauci for opposing Trump’s early travel restrictions.In his heated rant against Fauci’s nonsense, Navarro went on to chastise Fauci for being one of the earliest voices to oppose President Donald Trump’s early travel restrictions with China, emphasizing that Fauci had claimed that “travel restrictions don’t work.”The group ended up agreeing that the best path forward is to get the drug to the “hot zones” because it does help, and to allow patients to make the decision whether or not to use hydroxychloroquine themselves with the guidance of their physicians.During a recent press conference, President Trump also indicated that he had ordered 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to be placed into the Strategic National Stockpile.“There has never been a confrontation in the task force meetings like the one yesterday,” claimed a source about Navarro’s outburst at Fauci. “People speak up and there’s robust debate, but there’s never been a confrontation. Yesterday was the first confrontation.”When polled about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, about 37 percent of some 6,227 doctors in 30 countries indicated that it is currently the “most effective therapy” that they have at their disposal. This is compared to at least 14 other potential treatment options that are currently available.A whopping 72 percent of COVID-19 cases in Spain have had hydroxychloroquine prescribed, while almost half of all cases in Italy have had the drug prescribed. Hydroxychloroquine is also being used in about 41 percent of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Brazil, 39 percent of cases in Mexico, 28 percent of cases in France, and 23 percent of cases in the United States.Overall, almost 20 percent of physicians are now prescribing hydroxychloroquine for their high-risk patients, while a mere eight percent are prescribing it for their low-risk patients.",0
"The true agenda of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the current White House health advisor offering guidance on the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, couldn’t be clearer. And let’s just say that this agenda isn’t exactly a good one.The Obama regime leftover, who bragged a few years back that he’s worked in five different White House administrations, doesn’t want people to use hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus. Instead, he wants them to wait for a new “blockbuster” coronavirus vaccine, because that’s what will generate the biggest profits for the pharmaceutical industry.Fauci didn’t actually say this last part, of course, but he didn’t have to. By telling Americans not to look at hydroxychloroquine as a “knockout drug,” but to instead view some theoretical vaccine that doesn’t even exist yet as the “ultimate game changer,” Fauci has exposed himself as the deep state swamp creature that he truly is.“We still need to do the definitive studies to determine whether any intervention, not just this one, is truly safe and effective,” Fauci, who also directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), stated to Fox News. “But when you don’t have that information, it’s understandable why people might want to take something anyway even with the slightest hint of being effective.”This sounds like the same nonsense spewed by political hacks in prohibition states who are always calling for “more research” into the safety and effectiveness of cannabis, for instance, in order to “permit” their residents to use it. And the worst part is that there is solid evidence to show that hydroxychloroquine does, in fact, work for coronavirus patients. An international survey of some 6,227 doctors in 30 different countries determined that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is currently rated as the “most effective therapy” overall when it comes to treating the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), at least when it comes to pharmaceutical interventions.Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how zinc is another effective natural remedy for coronaviruses:Fauci knew Trump would face this coronavirus crisis because it was planned in advance.How we know without a doubt that Fauci is a lying scumbag who’s shilling for Big Pharma is the fact that he spoke about this coronavirus crisis back in 2017, openly admitting that President Trump would be facing a “surprise outbreak” during his presidential term.Somehow, Fauci knew in advance that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) would become a major global pandemic, and is now trying to stop people from using something that works, and instead wait for Bill Gates or whatever other vaccine interests are busily working on them to release vaccines that will supposedly provide a “cure” against this novel virus.Keep in mind that chloroquine tablets currently run about $.04 a dose, or about $1 per course. This is insanely inexpensive, and could easily provide blanket coverage for every person in the world. Meanwhile, a course of remdesivir, a drug that Fauci has personally invested his own money to support trials for, costs upwards of $1,000 per course.In other words, Fauci isn’t concerned with helping others. He’s concerned with helping himself and other shareholders who are obviously hoping to profit heavily from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis due to all of the new “therapeutics” they’re expecting to be unveiled in the coming months.“I think we see who Dr. Fauci is in bed with and it’s not the American people,” wrote one Infowars commenter.“Fauci is nothing more than a modern-day Joseph Mengele,” wrote another. “Experimenting on humans, touting and collaborating with eugenics fanatics, denying empirically effective and inexpensive treatments, Fauci is the 21st century Angel of Death.”",0
" the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the current pandemic, was purposely released by the Chinese in order to gain an economic advantage over other nations. ",0
"Firstly, no evidence has been presented to support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 was released from a laboratory in China, nor that this specific strain or a directly related ancestor was being studied in laboratories before the outbreak occurred. Although SARS-like coronaviruses are being studied in labs, they are distant relatives of the human-targeting SARS-CoV-2[1]. The closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2 is the bat virus RaTG13, which shares 96% identity with the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Even this close cousin is separated from SARS-CoV-2 by decades of evolution, as suggested by scientists here and here.In addition, scientists have found no evidence in the SARS-CoV-2 genome to indicate that it was human engineered. As Health Feedback reported here, a group of 27 researchers from several countries publicly rejected the allegation that the virus was laboratory-made[2]. As the authors pointed out: “Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens”.A recent study published in Nature Medicine on 17 March 2020 established that SARS-CoV-2 very likely evolved naturally, probably originating from a coronavirus in pangolins or bats (or both), and later developed the ability to infect humans.The so-called S protein, which is located on the surface of the enveloping membrane of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, allows the virus to bind to and infect animal cells. This protein displays a high affinity for a protein called ACE2 located on the surface of the targeted animal cells[4]. This is the same receptor that SARS-CoV-1, the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003-2005, targets. After the SARS outbreaks, researchers identified a set of key amino acids within the S protein which give SARS-CoV-1 a super-affinity for the ACE2 target receptor[4,5]. Surprisingly, the S protein of the current SARS-CoV-2 does not contain this optimal set of amino acids[3], yet is nonetheless able to bind ACE2 with a greater affinity than SARS-CoV-1[6]. This finding suggests that SARS-CoV-2 evolved independently and undermines the claim that it was manmade[3]. Indeed, the best engineering strategy would have been to harness the known and efficient amino acid sequences already described in SARS-CoV-1 to produce a more optimal molecular design for SARS-CoV-2. Over the past two decades, scientists have developed several genomic coronavirus “backbones” to be used as the initial framework for engineering experimental viruses, but the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 indicates that no such backbones are present[3]. Researchers have also determined through genome sequencing that SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in either bats or pangolins, or both[3,7]. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 shares 96% identity of its genome sequence with the bat coronavirus RaTG13 and 91% with a pangolin coronavirus isolated from dead animals. The percent identity with the pangolin coronavirus is even stronger in the key amino acids necessary for the binding of the virus to the targeted cells[3,7]. Altogether, this evidence strongly indicates that the virus originated in wildlife and developed the ability to infect humans at a later point in time.The robust scientific evidence that SARS-CoV-2 evolved naturally does not exclude the possibility that it could have escaped from a laboratory if any had indeed been studying it before the outbreak. However, in order for the hypothesis to be true, a lot of unlikely conditions would have had to be met. Firstly, a laboratory would have had to secretly harvest a natural precursor of SARS-CoV-2 from an unknown animal reservoir and culture it in the laboratory. Secondly, the scientists would have had to adapt the precursor virus to humans in the lab and then release it into the population—this is inconsistent with the results of genomic analyses indicating that the virus evolved naturally. While not impossible, such a chain of events is highly improbable and there is currently no evidence to support this claim. The article from the MyNaCl blog does not provide any information to support this hypothesis. In summary, genomic data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 shares a strong genetic identity with coronaviruses isolated from bats and pangolins, which suggests a natural origin. Additionally, the data do not contain any evidence of human engineering. Finally, there is no piece of evidence available either in the post or elsewhere to support the claim that the virus was intentionally released and/or propagated. Several competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain where the novel coronavirus actually came from. Health Feedback investigated the three most widespread origin stories for the novel coronavirus (engineered, lab-leak or natural infection), and examined the evidence for or against each proposed hypothesis in this Insight article.",1
Coronavirus does not cause a runny nose,0
"Runny nose and sputum are indeed symptoms of the common cold, but these same symptoms have been observed in some patients with COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, or diarrhea.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adds “shortness of breath” to the list of most common COVID-19 symptoms.It’s also possible for a person to become infected with more than one virus at the same time, such as influenza A[1]. Therefore, the presence of symptoms that are more common to other infections absolutely does not indicate the absence of infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.It is unclear whether the video is referring to the Celsius (C) or Fahrenheit (F) temperature scale. However, considering that both temperatures are below the average temperature of the human body (37°C or 98.6°F), this statement is illogical. If it were true, people would not become infected with SARS-CoV-2 by simple virtue of having a higher body temperature than the virus could withstand.

The WHO states in its “Myth busters” post: “You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.”

There is indeed some evidence that the sun can destroy certain viruses[2] and bacteria[3] in the environment. However, there is currently no evidence that the sun has the same effect on SARS-CoV-2, as previously reported by PolitiFact. CDC physician and researcher Nancy Messionnier told PolitiFact that “’it’s premature to assume’ the heat and sunlight will temper the virus.” And even if it turns out to be true that the sun could deactivate the virus, the amount of time it would take for this to happen is unlikely to be instantaneous, leaving a window of opportunity for infection even from sun-exposed surfaces. That’s why it’s important to use proper handwashing technique, as described by the CDC, after touching communal surfaces outside your home. According to the WHO, “COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.”

Droplets containing the virus cannot travel as far as airborne infectious particles. Therefore, the WHO recommends maintaining a minimum safe distance between self and others of three feet (1m), whereas the CDC recommends a distance of six feet (2m). The 10-foot distance recommended in the video may not be absolutely necessary, but it also couldn’t hurt.

The two health organizations base their recommendations on this concept, stated by the WHO: “Droplet transmission occurs when a person is in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets. […] transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer).”

As of early April 2020, however, research has begun to emerge indicating that the virus might also be airborne:The virus causing COVID-19 has indeed been identified on different types of surfaces for hours or even days, as Health Feedback previously reported. But it remains unknown how long the virus remains infectious on these surfaces and how likely it is for a person to become infected by touching them. Therefore, again, it is important to follow the prevention guidelines listed above, which are provided by reputable health agencies such as the WHO and CDC.

Handwashing for at least 20 seconds, or using hand sanitizer made of at least 60% alcohol when soap is not available, is an effective way to kill microbes on the skin. In the case of COVID-19, any soap will do because it destroys the lipid-based capsule that surrounds and protects the virus, leaving it exposed to degradation.
Antibacterial soaps are not harmful, but are also not more effective than regular soap since viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are not destroyed by antibacterial agents. Presumably, the claim meant to refer to antibacterial soap instead of “bacterial” soap. Health Feedback is not aware that such a product exists and it seems unlikely that one would ever be produced.normal laundry detergent will kill the virus on fabric. The CDC states: “In general, using a normal laundry detergent according to washing machine instructions and dry thoroughly using the warmest temperatures recommended on the clothing label.” The virus has been detected on fabric for as long as a day, as previously reported by Health Feedback, but it is still not known whether the virus remains infectious after this length of time.It is unknown how long SARS-CoV-2 can survive on skin. “It’s fair to say it stays long enough to spread from person to person,” said Mobeen H. Rathore, chief of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Wolfson Children’s Hospital of Jacksonville, Florida, to HuffPost.Again, because the virus’ survival on skin is unknown, it is important to follow the aforementioned handwashing guidelines.The virus does not always infect the throat first, as previously reported by Health Feedback. And there is no evidence to suggest that it remains isolated in one particular part of the body for any specific length of time. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 does not cause pneumonia in all infected individuals. In fact, as many as 25% of people will never experience any symptoms at all, but are still capable of passing the virus to others.High fever and shortness of breath are indeed possible, but not guaranteed, symptoms of COVID-19. Some individuals only realize they have contracted the disease after losing their sense of taste and smell without experiencing any other symptoms.Many physicians and hospitals are urging patients to not rush to the emergency room at the first sign of COVID-19 symptoms. Because if a person is experiencing only mild symptoms, they can be effectively treated at home without exposing other sick patients in the emergency room to contagion. Rather, many physicians recommend first calling their primary care doctor for advice. The CDC provides a handy “Coronavirus Self Checker” to help people evaluate their own symptoms and to determine when to seek appropriate medical care.It is true that by the time a person begins experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, the virus has already been spreading within the body for 1 to 14 days—the virus’ incubation period, as previously reported by Health Feedback. However, it is not “too late” to seek medical attention by the time symptoms appear.According to a 30 March study published in the Lancet[4], the case fatality rate for COVID-19—that is the proportion of deaths out of the total number of diagnosed cases—is only 1.4% averaged across all age groups. And when the researchers factored in their estimates of undiagnosed and asymptomatic cases, this rate fell to only 0.66%. Although death from COVID-19 infection is still much higher than that for influenza (0.1%), and mortality rates begin to rise steeply for individuals ages 60 and above, the chances of surviving infection for most individuals are quite good.The claim that the lung will have developed “50% fibrosis” by the time fever or cough develop, was previously debunked by Reuters, which cites an interview with Thomas Nash, an internist, pulmonologist, and infectious disease specialist at New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. Nash called the phrase a “non-medical concept.” He also pointed out that pulmonary (lung) “fibrosis takes months if not years to develop”, not the mere days mentioned in the claim.Holding your breath for 10 seconds is not a valid test for COVID-19. This claim has been debunked by Snopes and AFP Fact Check, among others.”Again, individuals concerned that they may have developed COVID-19 should consult their primary care physician for advice or refer to the CDC’s “Coronavirus Self Checker” to identify their symptoms and determine when to seek appropriate medical care.Drinking water frequently will not wash the virus away into the stomach where it will be destroyed by stomach acids. In fact, certain cells within the gastrointestinal tract possess the same ACE2 receptors that SARS-CoV-2 uses to target and infect cells of the respiratory tract. This claim was previously debunked by both the BBC and AAP FactCheck.In summary, most of the claims listed above regarding methods for diagnosing, treating, preventing, or curing COVID-19 are inaccurate. There is currently no effective cure or treatment for COVID-19, although many are being investigated in clinical trials. In the meantime, individuals should continue to follow the basic, well-tested precautionary measures such as frequent handwashing, disinfecting surfaces, avoiding touching the face, social distancing, and self-isolation when sick in order to prevent infection. And to seek medical advice from a trusted physician about when to seek treatment outside of the home.",1
"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others cause illness in certain types of animals. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the new strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. Sometimes coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and make people sick and become a new human coronavirus. Three recent examples of this are SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.The media has reported that some people are seeking “alternative” remedies to prevent or to treat COVID-19. Some of these purported remedies include herbal therapies, teas, essential oils, tinctures, and silver products such as colloidal silver. There is no scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure the illness caused by COVID-19. In fact, some of them may not be safe to consume.1,2 It’s important to understand that although many herbal or dietary supplements (and some prescription drugs) come from natural sources, “natural” does not always mean that it’s a safer or better option for your health. For tips on how to find accurate, reliable information about health, visit our Know the Science resources. While scientists at NIH and elsewhere are evaluating candidate therapies and vaccines to treat and prevent the novel coronavirus, currently there are no treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 infection approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid exposure to the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of this and other respiratory viruses, including the following:Clean your hands often.Avoid close contact.Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others.Cover coughs and sneezes.Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.Follow the instructions of your state and local authorities and current guidance regarding social distancing and other measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus.If you have a fever or cough, you might have COVID-19. Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home. If you have traveled to high risk countries or regions or were in close contact with someone with COVID-19 or think you may have been exposed to COVID-19, contact your health care provider immediately.  Keep track of your symptoms.If you have an emergency warning sign (including trouble breathing), get medical attention right away.",1

"Gargling warm salty water, taking vitamins or heating your nasal passages won’t eliminate the virus or keep it from reaching your lungs.There is little evidence that vitamins and other dietary supplements can protect you from the coronavirus in any consistent or significant way.There is no known cure for the new coronavirus.
Scientists are scrambling to find treatments and vaccines for the virus, which causes the illness Covid-19, and health care professionals are working to stop the spread of misinformation.It’s a tough battle. On social media, memes have become efficient vectors of bad advice, often with urgent instructions or dystopian graphics. One, misstating the benefits of gargling salty water, shows the virus as a cluster of green burrs infecting the throat of a glowing blue man.One series of posts with bad advice — including claims that sunshine could kill the virus and that ice cream should be avoided — tacked on the name UNICEF.
“This is, of course, not true,” said Christopher Tidey, a spokesman for UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund.“Misinformation during times of a health crisis can result in people being left unprotected or more vulnerable to the virus,” he said. “It can also spread paranoia, fear and stigmatization, and have other consequences, like offering a 0 sense of protection.”Here are some of the 0 claims that are spreading via Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp.Gargling warm water.There is no evidence that gargling warm water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the coronavirus, a claim that has gone viral as part of a meme — the one with the glowing blue man — in multiple languages. It suggests that the coronavirus lingers in the throat for days before it reaches the lungs, and that a good gargle can stop the virus in its tracks.That’s not true. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that gargling salty, warm water is one of many ways to soothe a sore throat, but there is no evidence that doing this will kill the coronavirus.“It won’t stop it from getting into the lungs,” said Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “What it could do is decrease inflammation, which would make your throat less sore.”Drinking water frequently.Some social media posts suggest that if you sip water every 15 minutes or so, you can protect yourself from the virus — which, in this scenario, has made its way to your mouth — by flushing it into your stomach. The idea here is that it wouldn’t enter your trachea, which leads to the lungs.But that’s 0. Staying hydrated is a good idea generally, and the C.D.C. says that healthy people can get their fluid needs by drinking when thirsty and with meals. But there is no evidence that frequent sips keep the virus from entering the lungs.Blasting hot air.A video that has been shared on Facebook claims that the virus cannot survive in hot temperatures. It shows a woman aiming a hair dryer at her face with the goal of heating her sinuses to the “coronavirus kill temperature” of 133 degrees. Elsewhere on social media, people have suggested that hand dryers can kill the virus.
But there is no clear evidence that this works. According to the World Health Organization, the virus cannot be killed by hand dryers, and it appears that it can survive in hot temperatures (and in cold temperatures).Dr. Offit said that there was some research indicating that warming the nasal passage might help the immune system combat a virus. But he added that breathing near steam — like sitting over a bowl of hot soup — was a much better idea than aiming a hair dryer at your face.“Do the soup thing,” he said. “That’s better than forcing air into your nose.”Ingesting colloidal silver.Many claims about the benefits of colloidal silver come from companies that sell the product.Colloidal silver comes in different forms — often as a bottled liquid with silver particles — and is promoted as a dietary supplement. But according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, evidence about the medical benefits are lacking, and silver can be harmful. One possible side effect is a condition called argyria, a blue-gray skin discoloration. Colloidal silver could also hinder the absorption of some drugs.Last week, the Food and Drug Administration said that it had warned seven companies to stop selling products, including colloidal silver, that the companies suggested cure or prevent the coronavirus.Getting some sun.It is not yet known what effect sunlight or ultraviolet light has on the new coronavirus. And if the virus is already reproducing inside of a human body, ultraviolet light — from the sun or from a lamp — can’t reach it.A walk in the sunshine might be good for your mental and physical health if you practice social distancing. And there is evidence that ultraviolet light can inactivate viruses, including flu viruses, particularly in laboratory settings.The W.H.O. warns, however, that ultraviolet light lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other body parts because they can irritate the skin.Taking your vitamins.Social media is full of suggestions about taking additional vitamins — C is a popular one — and ingesting things like garlic, pepper, mint or elderberry. But there is little evidence that these foods and supplements can protect you in any consistent or significant way.Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, hasn’t shown a consistent benefit for treating or preventing illnesses like the common cold. And as with many things, it can be harmful in large doses. “Do not take large quantities of an antioxidant knowing that your body needs to maintain a balance,” Dr. Offit said.Evidence that elderberry can help people with flu symptoms is spotty. Garlic may have some antimicrobial properties, but there is no evidence that it has protected people from the coronavirus.In short, vitamins and nutrients can be good, especially if they come from a balanced diet. But they can’t be relied upon to protect people from a pandemic.So what should we do?“Sound preparation, based on scientific evidence, is what is needed at this time,” said Mr. Tidey, of UNICEF.The C.D.C. offers the following guidance on what you can do to minimize your chances of contracting the virus: Wash your hands often, avoid touching your face and practice social distancing. You can also protect others by covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze, staying home when sick and disinfecting surfaces.
The W.H.O. has partnered with tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, to fight bad information about the coronavirus, and its website has debunked claims about saline, antibiotics, chlorine and other substances.Here is more coverage from The New York Times about the things you can do to stay safe.",1

And take the same precautions you would during a normal flu season: Encourage frequent hand-washing, move away from people who appear sick, and get the flu shot.As in airplanes, it’s always best to make sure your metaphorical oxygen mask is on before helping others. When talking to your children about an outbreak, make sure that you first assess their knowledge of the virus and that you process your own anxiety. It’s important that you don’t dismiss their fears and that you speak to them at an age-appropriate level.Be sure to be in communication with your child’s school, including about early dismissals or possible online instruction. Be prepared for schools to close; many districts and universities around the world have already taken that step.It’s also good to communicate with your workplace about child-care concerns that you have.If your children are stuck at home, get some games going, turn on a movie and try to make it feel a little like a vacation, at least for the first few days.For more information about children and the pandemic, read 11 Questions Parents May Have About Coronavirus.",1

"It’s unclear what an economic recovery will look like — or when it will come.The impact of the virus on the United States economy has been swift and devastating.

"It seems to spread very easily, making containment efforts difficult.The scale of an outbreak depends on how quickly and easily a virus is transmitted from person to person.The new coronavirus seems to spread very easily, especially in homes, hospitals, churches, cruise ships and other confined spaces. It is much more contagious than SARS, another coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 and sickened about 8,000 people.The pathogen can travel through the air, enveloped in tiny respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes.These droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. That makes the virus harder to get than pathogens like measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, which can travel 100 feet through the air. But it is easier to catch than H.I.V. or hepatitis, which spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.Research is still in its early stages, but some estimates suggest that each person with the new coronavirus could infect between two and four people without effective containment measures. That is enough to sustain and accelate an outbreak, if nothing is done to reduce it.Here’s how that works. In the animation below, a group of five infected people could spread the virus to about 368 people over just five cycles of infection.If 5 people with new coronavirus each infected 2.6 others, there could be 368 people sick after 5 cycles.Compare that with a less contagious virus, like the seasonal flu, which can be slowed by vaccines and immunity from past epidemics. People with the flu tend to infect 1.3 other individuals, on average. The difference may seem small, but the result is a striking contrast: Only about 45 people might be infected in the same scenario.If 5 people with seasonal flu each infected 1.3 others, there could be 45 people sick after 5 cycles.The transmission numbers of any disease aren’t set in stone. They can change depending on how much people interact at school, work or religious gatherings. When global health authorities methodically tracked and isolated people infected with SARS in 2003, they were able to bring the average number each sick person infected down to 0.4, enough to stop the outbreak.Health authorities around the world are expending enormous effort trying to repeat that. But the number of people infected globally is rising quickly, with large clusters of cases in Italy, Iran, Japan and South Korea.The virus’s high rate of transmission means containment measures — such as wearing masks, keeping a distance from infected people and implementing quarantines if people are exposed — must block more than 60 percent of transmissions in order to effectively control the outbreak, which is difficult.Coronavirus cases have far surpassed the rate of new SARS cases in 2003",1
"It’s hard to know yet. But the fatality rate may be more than 1 percent, much higher than the seasonal flu.This is one of the most important factors in how damaging the outbreak will be, and one of the least understood.It’s tough to assess the lethality of a new virus. The worst cases are usually detected first, which can skew our understanding of how likely patients are to die. People with mild illness may never visit a doctor, and there may be more cases than China is counting, leading to a lower death rate than initially thought.“It’s easier to miss mild cases that resolve by themselves than it is to miss dead people,” said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health.But early research indicates the virus may be significantly more deadly than the seasonal flu, which kills roughly one in 1,000 people. An analysis of outcomes for more than 44,000 confirmed patients in China found that roughly one in 50 died. Eighty-one percent of patients infected with the new coronavirus had mild illness, 14 percent had severe illness and 5 percent had critical illness, according to the study.The pathogen is considerably less dangerous than other coronaviruses, such as MERS, which kills about a third of people who become infected, and SARS, which kills about 1 in 10. All of the diseases appear to latch on to proteins on the surface of lung cells, but MERS and SARS seem to be more destructive to lung tissue.Here’s how the new coronavirus compares with other infectious diseases:The chart above uses a logarithmic vertical scale: data near the top is compressed into a smaller space to make the variation between less-deadly diseases easier to see. Diseases near the top of the chart are much deadlier than those in the middle.
Older people are much more likely to face serious illness than younger people, the analysis of Chinese patients found. In that study, nearly 15 percent of infected people over 80 died, along with 8 percent of people in their 70s. Very few young children seem to be falling ill, a pattern seen with some other respiratory viruses.
Those numbers could be reduced as more cases are discovered. And it is possible that death rates at the center of the outbreak in China, where hospitals were overwhelmed, will end up higher than elsewhere in the world.Pathogens can still be very dangerous even if their fatality rate is low. Even though influenza has a case fatality rate below one per 1,000, roughly 200,000 people end up hospitalized with the virus each year in the United States, and about 35,000 people die.",1
"Typically between five and seven days, allowing the illness to go undetected.The time it takes for symptoms to appear after a person is infected can be vital for prevention and control. Known as the incubation period, this time can allow health officials to quarantine or observe people who may have been exposed to the virus. But if the incubation period is too long or too short, these measures may be difficult to implement.Some illnesses, like influenza, have a short incubation period of two or three days. People may be shedding infectious virus particles before they exhibit flu symptoms, making it almost impossible to identify and isolate people who have the virus. SARS had an incubation period of about five days, and it took four or five days after symptoms started before sick people could transmit the virus. That gave officials time to stop the virus and effectively contain the outbreak.
Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the new coronavirus has an incubation period of two to 14 days. When symptoms do start to appear, they can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.But mild cases may simply resemble the flu or a bad cold, and people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even before they develop obvious symptoms.
“That concerns me because it means the infection could elude detection,” said Dr. Mark Denison, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.",1
"Enough to spread the outbreak all over the world.Wuhan was a difficult place to contain an outbreak. It has 11 million people, more than New York City. On an average day, 3,500 passengers take direct flights from Wuhan to cities in other countries. These cities were among the first to report cases of the virus outside China.Wuhan is also a major transportation hub within China, linked to Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities by high-speed railways and domestic airlines. In October and November of last year, close to two million people flew from Wuhan to other places within China.China was not nearly as well connected in 2003 during the SARS outbreak. Large numbers of migrant workers now travel domestically and internationally — to Africa, other parts of Asia and Latin America, where China is making an enormous infrastructure push with its Belt and Road Initiative. This travel creates a high risk for outbreaks in countries with health systems that are not equipped to handle them, like Zimbabwe, which is facing a worsening hunger and economic crisis.Over all, China has about four times as many train and air passengers as it did during the SARS outbreak. In January, China took the unprecedented step of imposing travel restrictions on tens of millions of people living in Wuhan and nearby cities. Some experts questioned the effectiveness of the lockdown, and Wuhan’s mayor acknowledged that five million people had left the city before the restrictions began, in the run-up to the Lunar New Year.
“You can’t board up a germ. A novel infection will spread,” said Lawrence O. Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “It will get out; it always does.”Several countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea, are already discovering clusters of cases with no clear ties to the outbreak's epicenter in China. On Feb. 26, the C.D.C. also reported what it called possibly the first case of community spread in the United States.",1
"China has slowed new cases for now, but the spread around the world is accelerating.World Health Organization officials have praised China’s aggressive response to the virus — walling off cities, forcing people to stay home and tracking large numbers of contacts of infected people — saying that it helped curb the spread of more cases. The daily tally of new cases there peaked and then plateaued between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2, and has steadily declined since.Many countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness. Airlines and cruise lines have canceled service to many Asian destinations.
Critics fear those measures won’t be enough.The rate at which transmissions are spreading in several countries makes it seem “unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus,” said Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore.The ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend on the strength of their health systems; their capacity to test, provide hospital beds, drugs and respirators for severely ill patients; and their effectiveness in communicating to the public.",1
"A few drugs are being tested in clinical trials,but a vaccine is still at least a year away.There are no approved treatments for any coronavirus diseases, including the new coronavirus.Several drugs are being tested, and some initial findings are expected soon. An antiviral medication called remdesivir appears to be effective in animals, and it was used to treat the first American patient in Washington State. Researchers are now testing the drug in clinical trials in the United States, China and other countries.
Several groups are also working to develop a vaccine for the virus in order to stop the spread of the disease. But vaccines take time.After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.) By the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the development timeline down to six months.Now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline even further. Researchers have already studied the genome of the new coronavirus and found the proteins that are crucial for infection. Scientists from the National Institutes of Health, in Australia and at least three companies are working on vaccine candidates.“If we don’t run into any unforeseen obstacles, we’ll be able to get a Phase 1 trial going within the next three months,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Dr. Fauci cautioned that it could still take months, and even years, after initial trials to conduct extensive testing that can prove a vaccine is safe and effective. In the best case, a vaccine may become available to the public a year from now.",1
"The Trump administration released several pages of simple behaviors for keeping schools, homes and businesses safe during a coronavirus outbreak.The Trump administration on Monday night issued several pages of tips for navigating the coronavirus, organizing a set of recommendations for schools, businesses, homes and offices into a document that resembles easy-on-the-eye restaurant food-safety charts.The simple behaviors recommended in the guidelines — like washing hands, managing air flow, protecting food and carving out private space in a home — show how federal health officials believe the virus could influence everyday life.“These are really simple, low-tech things,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, said at a White House news briefing. “There’s nothing in there that’s complicated. But it’s just stated in a way that’s clear, that people can understand.”After the briefing, Vice President Mike Pence posted images of the guidelines on Twitter. They are expected to also be published on Coronavirus.gov, a federal hub of virus information where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already posted similar advice.Here is what the guidelines recommend.
How to navigate the office.Stay home if you or family members who live with you are sick. Several top health officials have repeatedly urged Americans to not risk going to work if they come down with symptoms that might indicate an infection.Use the usual electronic means of work life, like email, to remind yourself to wash your hands. Devise ways to remember to not touch your face. And avoid shaking hands — “noncontact methods of greeting” are preferable.Instead of in-person meetings, the guidelines suggest teleconferencing. If meetings are held in person, they should be in open, well-ventilated rooms. Open windows will help.The World Health Organization warns that “poorly ventilated buildings affect air quality and can contribute to the spread of disease,” and that in health facilities with a high concentration of infectious patients, poor ventilation worsens the risk of transmission.How to divide a home
Divvy up your home to account for the elderly or those with underlying conditions that make them particularly susceptible to infection. Make a “protected space” for those at risk, and give the sick their own rooms, where the door should be kept closed. Only one person should care for the ill.Healthy people in your home should act as if they could be a risk to the vulnerable, washing their hands frequently before interacting with them.How to keep a school safe.Schools should avoid mixing ages and consider adjusting or postponing in-school and extracurricular gatherings that intermingle classes and grades. Classes should be held outdoors, if possible, or anywhere well ventilated.Students should limit sharing food, and cafeteria workers should practice strict hygiene. Schools should screen cafeteria workers and those they come in contact with.How to protect a business.Businesses should limit attendance at large gatherings and use online transactions for events, avoiding the kind of close contact that occurs at box offices. The advice follows news of several large event cancellations, including the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, a major professional tennis tournament in California and a health conference where President Trump was scheduled to speak.Businesses should promote “tap and pay” machines that cut down on the use of cash, a notorious germ-carrying material.Drivers for ride-sharing services and taxis should keep their windows open and regularly disinfect surfaces. Uber has said it will offer drivers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are infected with the coronavirus or are quarantined.",1
"Answers to your most common questions about the best practices for stemming the tide of the coronavirus pandemic.On Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended against any gatherings of 50 or more people over the next eight weeks, in an effort to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Many public schools, libraries, universities, places of worship, and sporting and cultural institutions have also shut down for at least the next few weeks. These measures are an attempt to enforce distance between people, a proven way to slow pandemics.Experts have also been urging people to practice voluntary “social distancing.” The term has been trending on Twitter, with even President Trump endorsing it on Saturday.Still, people all over the United States have been out in large numbers at restaurants, bars and even sporting events, suggesting more than a little confusion around what social distancing is and who should be practicing it.This is deeply worrying, experts said, because even those who become only mildly ill — and maybe even those who never even know they are infected — can propel the exponential movement of the virus through the population.They emphasized that it’s important for everyone to practice social distancing, not just those considered to be at high risk or who are seriously ill.“These are not normal times, this is not a drill,” said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama in Birmingham. “We have never been through anything like this before.”What exactly is social distancing? We asked experts for practical guidance.What is social distancing?Put simply, the idea is to maintain a distance between you and other people — in this case, at least six feet.That also means minimizing contact with people. Avoid public transportation whenever possible, limit nonessential travel, work from home and skip social gatherings — and definitely do not go to crowded bars and sporting arenas.“Every single reduction in the number of contacts you have per day with relatives, with friends, co-workers, in school will have a significant impact on the ability of the virus to spread in the population,” said Dr. Gerardo Chowell, chair of population health sciences at Georgia State University.This strategy saved thousands of lives both during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and, more recently, in Mexico City during the 2009 flu pandemic.I’m young and don’t have any risk factors. Can I continue to socialize?Please don’t. There is no question that older people and those with underlying health conditions are most vulnerable to the virus, but young people are by no means immune.And there is a greater public health imperative. Even people who show only mild symptoms may pass the virus to many, many others — particularly in the early course of the infection, before they even realize they are sick. So you might keep the chain of infection going right to your own older or high-risk relatives. You may also contribute to the number of people infected, causing the pandemic to grow rapidly and overwhelm the health care system.If you ignore the guidance on social distancing, you will essentially put yourself and everyone else at much higher risk.Experts acknowledged that social distancing is tough, especially for young people who are used to gathering in groups. But even cutting down the number of gatherings, and the number of people in any group, will help.Can I leave my house?Absolutely. The experts were unanimous in their answer to this question.It’s O.K. to go outdoors for fresh air and exercise — to walk your dog, go for a hike or ride your bicycle, for example. The point is not to remain indoors, but to avoid being in close contact with people.You may also need to leave the house for medicines or other essential resources. But there are things you can do to keep yourself and others safe during and after these excursions.When you do leave your home, wipe down any surfaces you come into contact with, disinfect your hands with an alcohol-based sanitizer and avoid touching your face. Above all, frequently wash your hands — especially whenever you come in from outside, before you eat or before you’re in contact with the very old or very young.Can I go to the supermarket?Yes. But buy as much as you can at a time in order to minimize the number of trips, and pick a time when the store is least likely to be crowded.When you do go, be aware that any surface inside the store may be contaminated. Use a disinfecting wipe to clean the handle of the grocery cart, for example. Experts did not recommend wearing gloves, but if you do use them, make sure you don’t touch your face until you have removed the gloves.
Dr. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, recommends stowing your cellphone in an inaccessible place so that you don’t absent-mindedly reach for it while shopping. “That could be a transmission opportunity,” she said.If it’s a long shopping trip, you may want to bring hand sanitizer with you and disinfect your hands in between. And when you get home, Dr. Rivers said, wash your hands right away.Those at high risk may want to avoid even these outings if they can help it, especially if they live in densely populated areas.Dr. Marrazzo said her mother is an “incredibly healthy” 93-year-old who usually drives herself to the store, but she said she has asked her mother not to go out during this time, because “the risks are too great given the age-related mortality we’re seeing.”Can I go out to dinner at a restaurant?
Some countries have closed down restaurants and bars for the next few weeks, but there is no specific nationwide guidance yet on this in the U.S. beyond the C.D.C.’s recommendation against gatherings of more than 50 people.Before New York City announced it would be shutting down restaurants and bars, they were supposed to be operating at half capacity to maintain social distancing and soften the economic impact. But in small restaurants, that may still mean you’re too close to other diners. It’s also not possible to maintain true social distance from the people preparing or serving the food.In general, avoid going out to restaurants, Dr. Marrazzo said, but, “If you’re going to go, go to some place that you trust.” Choose spacious restaurants and ones where the staff members likely practice good hygiene. Better yet, opt for takeout. If you’re concerned for the restaurant’s financial future, ask about purchasing gift certificates you can redeem later.Can family come to visit?That depends on who is in your family and how healthy they are.“Certainly, sick family should not visit,” said Dr. Marrazzo. “If you have vulnerable people in your family, or who are very old, then limit in-person contact.”But if everyone in the family is young and healthy, then some careful interaction in small groups is probably OK. “The smaller the gathering, the healthier the people are to start with, the lower the risk of the situation is going to be,” she said.At the same time, you don’t want family members to feel isolated or not have the support of loved ones, so check in with them by phone or plan activities to do with them on video.Can I take my kids to the playground?That depends. If your children have any illness, even if it’s not related to the coronavirus, keep them at home.If they seem healthy and desperately need to burn energy, outdoor activities such as bike rides are generally OK. But “people, especially in higher-risk areas, may want to think twice about trips to high-traffic public areas like the playground,” said Dr. Neha Chaudhary, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School.Kids also tend to touch their mouths, noses and faces constantly, so parks or playgrounds with few kids and few contaminated surfaces are ideal. Take hand sanitizer with you and clean any surfaces with disinfecting wipes before they play.Serious illness from this virus in kids is rare, so the kids themselves might be safe. “That doesn’t mean they can’t come home and give it to Grandma,” said Dr. Marazzo.So kids should wash their hands often, especially before they come into contact with older or high-risk family members.I’m scared to feel alone. Is there anything I can do to make this easier?It’s a scary and uncertain time. Staying in touch with family and friends is more important than ever, because we are biologically hard-wired to seek each other out when we are stressed, said Dr. Jonathan Kanter, director for the Center for Science of Social connection at the University of Washington in Seattle.
Dr. Kanter said he was particularly worried about the long-term impact of social isolation on both the sick and the healthy. The absence of physical touch can have a profound impact on our stress levels, he said, and make us feel under threat.He said even imagining a warm embrace from a loved one can calm the body’s fight-or-flight response.In the meantime, we are lucky enough to have technologies at hand that can maintain social connections. “It’s important to note that social distancing does not mean social isolation,” Dr. Chaudhary said.
She suggested people stay connected via social media, chat and video. Be creative: Schedule dinners with friends over FaceTime, participate in online game nights, plan to watch television shows at the same time, enroll in remote learning classes. It’s especially important to reach out to those who are sick or to high-risk people who are self-isolating. “A phone call with a voice is better than text, and a video chat is better than a telephone call,” Dr. Kanter said.
How long will we need to practice social distancing?That is a big unknown, experts said. A lot will depend on how well the social distancing measures in place work and how much we can slow the pandemic down. But prepare to hunker down for at least a month, and possibly much longer.In Seattle, the recommendations on social distancing have continued to escalate with the number of infections and deaths, and as the health system has become increasingly strained.“For now, it’s probably indefinite,” Dr. Marrazzo said. “We’re in uncharted territory.”",1
"What you need to know about how the virus is transmitted.A delicate but highly contagious virus, roughly one-900th the width of a human hair, is spreading from person to person around the world. The coronavirus, as it’s known, has already infected more than 200,000 people in 140 countries.Because this virus is so new, experts’ understanding of how it spreads is limited. They can, however, offer some guidance about how it does — and does not — seem to be transmitted.If I cross paths with a sick person, will I get sick, too?You walk into a crowded grocery store. A shopper has the coronavirus. What puts you most at risk of getting infected by that person?Experts agree they have a great deal to learn, but four factors are likely to play some role: how close you get; how long you are near the person; whether that person projects viral droplets on you; and how much you touch your face. (Of course, your age and health are also major factors.)
Also, the larger the number of people in the store — or in any other situation —  the greater the chance that you’ll cross paths with an infected person, which is why so many health officials are now urging people to avoid crowds and to cancel gatherings large and small.What’s a viral droplet?It is a droplet containing viral particles. A virus is a tiny codependent microbe that attaches to a cell, takes over, makes more of itself and moves on to its next host. This is its “lifestyle,” said Gary Whittaker, a professor of virology at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.A “naked” virus can’t go anywhere unless it’s hitching a ride with a droplet of mucus or saliva, said Kin-on Kwok, a professor at the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.These mucus and saliva droplets are ejected from the mouth or the nose as we cough, sneeze, laugh, sing, breathe and talk. If they don’t hit something along the way, they typically land on the floor or the ground. When the virus becomes suspended in droplets smaller than five micrometers — known as aerosols — it can stay suspended for about a half-hour, research suggests.   To gain access to your cells, the viral droplets must enter through the eyes, the nose or the mouth. Some experts believe that sneezing and coughing are most likely the primary forms of transmission. Professor Kwok said talking face-to-face or sharing a meal with someone could pose a risk.Julian Tang, a virologist and a professor at the University of Leicester in England who is researching the coronavirus with Professor Kwok, agreed.“If you can smell what someone had for lunch — garlic, curry, etc. — you are inhaling what they are breathing out, including any virus in their breath,” he said.The virus does not linger in the air at high enough levels to be a risk to most people. But the techniques health care workers use to care for sick people can generate high levels of aerosols. This is part of why it’s so important that they have proper protective equipment.How close is too close?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends keeping a distance of six feet from other people to minimize the possibility of infection. (A useful way to think about six feet is that it’s roughly twice the length of the average person’s extended arm.Three feet is the distance the W.H.O. emphasizes as particularly risky when standing near a person who is coughing or sneezing.Still, other public health experts say that at this crucial moment, when the world still has an opportunity to slow the transmission of the coronavirus, any number of feet is too close. By cutting out all but essential in-person interactions, we can help flatten the curve, they say, keeping the number of sick people to levels that medical providers can manage.How long is too long to be near an infected person?It’s not yet clear, but most experts agree that more time equals more risk.Will you know a person is sick?Not necessarily.Fever, coughing, chest pain and shortness of breath may signal that someone has been infected with the coronavirus. (Covid-19 is the name for the disease caused by the virus.But it has become increasingly clear that people without symptoms can also infect others. In some cases, these people may later feel terrible enough to try to get tested, isolate themselves, seek treatment and notify friends and colleagues about potential risk. In still other cases, people with the virus may never experience the physical discomfort that would tip them off to the fact that they have been a danger to others.  Can the virus last on a bus pole, a touch screen or other surface?Yes. After numerous people who attended a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong fell ill, the city’s Center for Health Protection collected samples from the site. Restroom faucets and the cloth covers over Buddhist texts tested positive for the coronavirus, the agency said.This coronavirus is just the latest of many similarly shaped viruses. (Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, which resemble a crown or the sun’s corona.A recent study of the novel coronavirus found that it could live for three days on plastic and steel. If you are ordering lots of supplies online, you may be relieved to know that the virus did poorly on cardboard — it disintegrated over the course of a day.  It survived for about four hours on copper.Whether a surface looks dirty or clean is irrelevant. If an infected person sneezed and a droplet landed on a surface, a person who then touched that surface could pick it up. How much is required to infect a person is unclear.But as long as you wash your hands before touching your face, you should be OK, because viral droplets don’t pass through skin.Also, coronaviruses are relatively easy to destroy. Using a simple disinfectant on a surface is nearly guaranteed to break the delicate envelope that surrounds the tiny microbe, rendering it harmless, Professor Whittaker said.Does the brand or type of soap you use matter?No, several experts said.My neighbor is coughing. Should I be worried?There is no evidence that viral particles can go through walls or glass, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.He said he was more concerned about the dangers posed by common spaces than those posed by vents, provided there is good air circulation in a room.

"The concepts of social distancing and self-quarantine are being interpreted in a variety of ways, not always correctly. Here’s a guide to help you make the right decisions.When Dr. Asaf Bitton looked out from his window in Boston recently, he was shocked by the scene. Although schools, offices and businesses already had shut down to slow the spread of coronavirus, the park was packed.“I saw people from my window outside playing in the park together, and I thought, ‘This is crazy,’” said Dr. Bitton, executive director of Ariadne Labs at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Why did we close the schools if we’re going to shift social contact from the schools to the playground?”With a sense of urgency, he sent his wife an email to share with friends and post on Facebook. It quickly went viral and was later published on Medium, under the headline: “Social Distancing: This Is Not a Snow Day.” To slow the coronavirus, wrote Dr. Bitton, we must act quickly and start “making daily choices to stay away from each other as much as possible.”But how to make those choices has not always been clear. Concepts like “social distancing,” “self-quarantine” and “isolation” come from the lexicon of the infectious disease community (and scary movies). Here in real life, parents, workers and even government leaders are struggling to make sense of it all. Here’s a guide to help you make good decisions, based on advice from infectious disease and public health experts.Social Distancing
Social distancing is ultimately about creating physical distance between people who don’t live together. At the community level, it means closing schools and workplaces and canceling events like concerts and Broadway shows. For individuals, it means keeping six feet of distance between you and others while in public and avoiding physical contact with people who do not share your home.But one aspect of social distancing — the admonition to avoid gatherings of 10 people or more — has created a lot of confusion. It has given the impression that while public indoor events are bad, it’s OK to host up to nine people at your home or outside. That is not correct. Right now everyone should limit close contact, indoors and outdoors, to family members only. This means no dinner parties, no play dates, no birthday parties with a few friends.Who should do this? Everyone.Shelter in Place.In a nutshell, this means stay home. Don’t leave the house unless you absolutely have to. Don’t socialize with people outside your family. Don’t go to a friend’s house for dinner or invite a trusted friend over.During a shelter-in-place order, you are typically allowed to go outside for essentials — to pick up groceries or prescriptions — but you should limit those trips to no more than once a week if possible. People with essential jobs — public safety, medical, sanitation or grocery worker — can still go to work. And you can visit someone if you are their caregiver.There is a bright spot. In most cases, a shelter-in-place order allows you to walk the dog or exercise outside (for brief periods) as long as you keep a six-foot distance from others.“Right now I’m recommending to my family and to people who are asking that outdoor activities that are solitary or done in parallel with someone who is far away is fine,” said Carolyn C. Cannuscio, associate professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. “We’re trying to avoid face to face contact, especially in close up and confined spaces.”Who should do this? Everyone who lives in an area with a mandatory shelter-in-place order, including some communities in Northern California and possibly, soon, New York City. But many infectious disease experts say that everyone else should also voluntarily shelter in place to prevent the virus from spreading. “People should really be keeping to themselves,” said Dr. Kryssie Woods, hospital epidemiologist and director of infection prevention at Mount Sinai West.Self-Monitoring
This means regularly checking your temperature and watching for signs of coronavirus infection, including fever, shortness of breath and coughing. A person who is self-monitoring should already be staying home and limiting interactions with others.Who should do this? Self-monitoring is for people who learn they might have been exposed to the virus but had only distant contact with the infected person. This might be someone in your orbit — for example, a colleague, a speaker at a conference or the parent of your child’s classmate — but not a person with whom you had close physical contact. Consult with your doctor to see if self-monitoring is recommended for your specific situation.Self-Quarantine. This term is used to separate and restrict the movement of someone who is well but who recently had close contact with a person who later was diagnosed with the virus. A person in self-quarantine should follow all the rules of sheltering in place, except they should avoid going to stores or interacting with the public even on a limited basis for a 14-day period. (A friend should bring you groceries.)Quarantine means staying home and away from other people, including those in your household, as much as possible, for a 14-day quarantine period. A person in self-quarantine should sleep in a separate space from family members.Who should do this? Anyone who does not have symptoms, but who had close contact with someone who later became ill.Self-Isolation. Isolation is used to separate a person who has a diagnosed case or someone who has distinct symptoms including a cough, fever and shortness of breath, but hasn’t yet been tested or received test results. A person in isolation should be confined to a separate room with no or minimal contact with the rest of the household (including pets) and use a separate bathroom if possible. Most of the time, a sick person will feel a bit miserable, but he or she can pick up food trays left at the door and sanitize a shared bathroom after using it.Who should do this? Anyone with a confirmed case of Covid-19, in consultation with their doctor, a person waiting for test results or a person with obvious symptoms who is still waiting to be tested. Everyone else in the household should self-quarantine.Official or Mandatory Quarantine.A government-imposed lockdown on a community, as has happened in Italy, in which movements are severely restricted. People can still go out for essentials and to get fresh air, but they can do so only under strictly controlled conditions or on a specific schedule imposed by public safety officials.Who should do this? Everyone who lives in an area under quarantine. “We haven’t seen this in the U.S.,” Dr. Bitton said. “I don’t know if it’s coming.”",1
"The C.D.C. director says new data about people who are infected but symptom-free could lead the agency to recommend broadened use of masks.As many as 25 percent of people infected with the new coronavirus may not show symptoms, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns — a startlingly high number that complicates efforts to predict the pandemic’s course and strategies to mitigate its spread.In particular, the high level of symptom-free cases is leading the C.D.C. to consider broadening its guidelines on who should wear masks.“This helps explain how rapidly this virus continues to spread across the country,” the director, Dr. Robert Redfield, told a National Public Radio affiliate in Atlanta in an interview broadcast on Monday.The agency has repeatedly said that ordinary citizens do not need to wear masks unless they are feeling sick. But with the new data on people who may be infected without ever feeling sick, or who are transmitting the virus for a couple of days before feeling ill, Mr. Redfield said that such guidance was “being critically re-reviewed.”Researchers do not know precisely how many people are infected without feeling ill, or if some of them are simply presymptomatic. But since the new coronavirus surfaced in December, they have spotted unsettling anecdotes of apparently healthy people who were unwitting spreaders.“Patient Z,” for example, a 26-year-old man in Guangdong, China, was a close contact of a Wuhan traveler infected with the coronavirus in February. But he felt no signs of anything amiss, not on Day 7 after the contact, nor on Day 10 or 11.Already by Day 7, though, the virus had bloomed in his nose and throat, just as copiously as in those who did become ill. Patient Z might have felt fine, but he was infected just the same.Researchers now say that people like Patient Z are not merely anecdotes. For example, as many as 18 percent of people infected with the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship never developed symptoms, according to one analysis. A team in Hong Kong suggests that from 20 to 40 percent of transmissions in China occurred before symptoms appeared.The high level of covert spread may help explain why the novel coronavirus set off a pandemic in a way that the SARS and MERS viruses did not.The new virus spreads about as easily as flu, “and when’s the last time anyone thought anything about stopping influenza transmission, short of the vaccine?” said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota.With any vaccine still in early development, the best way to mitigate the pandemic is social distancing, he and other experts said. Because people may be passing the virus on to others even when they feel fine, asking only unwell people to stay home is unlikely to be enough. This is why many experts, going against recommendations by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization, are now urging everyone to wear masks — to prevent those who are unaware they have the virus from spreading it.Like influenza, some experts now say, this virus appears to spread both through large droplets and droplets smaller than five micrometers — termed aerosols — containing the virus that infected people might release especially while coughing, but also while merely exhaling. They emphasized that the level of virus in both types of particles is low, so simply jogging or walking by an infected person does not put people at risk.“If you have a passing contact with an infectious person, you would have a very, very low chance of transmission occurring,” said Dr. Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong.The risk goes up with sustained contact — during face-to-face conversation, for example, or by sharing the same air space for a prolonged time. In addition to its confusing stance on masks, “the W.H.O. has been saying aerosol transmission doesn’t occur, which is also perplexing,” Dr. Cowling said, adding, “I think both are actually wrong.”Experts agreed that infections were being passed along by people who do not report symptoms — what they call asymptomatic transmissions — but they also noted some confusion around the term.“There’s no standard definition for it, and you could say to yourself, Well, that’s kind of ridiculous: You either have symptoms or you don’t,” said Dr. Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious diseases expert at Columbia University. But studies by his team have shown, he said, that some people never notice their symptoms, others are unable to distinguish the infection from their smoker’s cough or allergies or other conditions, and still others may feel every pain acutely.There is also a largely semantic debate about what proportion of people who appear to be perfectly fine but then become ill — as in the report in The New England Journal of Medicine of an apparently asymptomatic spreader who later acknowledged having felt mild symptoms.Ultimately, Dr. Shaman said, these definitions are unimportant.“The bottom line is that there are people out there shedding the virus who don’t know that they’re infected,” he said.Where the definitions may matter is in being able to understand the true scope of the pandemic.Dr. Cowling’s team has analyzed data from China at various stages in the pandemic. The W.H.O.’s mission to China concluded that most people who were infected with the virus had significant symptoms. But in the early weeks of the epidemic, his analysis shows, China set a high bar for what constituted a confirmed case of infection — requiring respiratory symptoms, fever and a chest X-ray for pneumonia.Their definition left out mild and asymptomatic cases and, as a result, the team vastly underestimated the scale and nature of the outbreak there.“We’ve estimated in China that between 20 percent and 40 percent of transmission events occurred before symptoms appeared,” Dr. Cowling said.
A separate analysis of the hundreds of people cloistered aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship bears out this scale. Once the ship docked in Japan on Feb. 5, researchers tested all of the passengers and reviewed those who tested positive for the virus on multiple occasions over a two-week period. They found that 18 percent of the infected passengers remained symptom-free throughout.“The substantial asymptomatic proportion for Covid-19 is quite alarming,” said Dr. Gerardo Chowell, an epidemiologist at Georgia State University who worked on the analysis.Dr. Chowell noted that the passengers on the ship tended to be older and therefore more likely to develop symptoms. He estimated that about 40 percent in the general population might be able to be infected without showing signs of it.There have also been many hints, subtle and not, that the virus can be transmitted via aerosols. Sixty members of a choir in Mount Vernon, Wash., north of Seattle, gathered on March 10 for a practice session for over two and a half hours. None of them felt ill, and they made no contact with one another. But by this weekend, dozens of the members had fallen ill, and two had died.Their experience points toward airborne transmission via aerosols, which can travel farther than the large droplets the W.H.O. and the C.D.C. have emphasized. The virus is still most likely to be expelled with a cough or a sneeze, as far as eight meters (about 26 feet), according to one study. But studies on influenza and other respiratory viruses, including other coronaviruses, have shown that people can release aerosols containing the virus simply by breathing or talking — or, presumably, by singing.“I think increasing evidence suggests the virus is spread not just through droplets but through aerosols,” Dr. Chowell said. “It would make a lot of sense to encourage at the very least face mask use in enclosed spaces including supermarkets.”Several studies have shown now that people infected with the new coronavirus are most contagious about one to three days before they begin to show symptoms. This presymptomatic transmission was not true of the coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS.“This is where we got very lucky with SARS, was that it really didn’t transmit until after people were showing symptoms, and that made it much easier to detect it and shut it down with aggressive public health measures,” said Dr. Carl Bergstrom, an expert in emerging infectious diseases at the University of Washington in Seattle.With the new coronavirus, there is transmission by healthy-seeming people, and often severe symptoms and a high fatality rate. “That whole combination makes it very, very tough to fight using standard public health measures,” he said.A separate analysis from the C.D.C. on Tuesday offered new evidence that a significant portion of people with severe coronavirus infections in the United States have underlying medical conditions. The agency looked at 7,162 cases, a small subset of the 122,000 cases in the U.S., but the findings provided a stark portrait. Of 457 people in that subset who were admitted to intensive care units, 32 percent suffered from diabetes; 29 percent had heart disease; and 21 percent had lung disease. Overall, 78 percent of people with Covid-19 admitted to the I.C.U. had at least one pre-existing condition. The study did not look at deaths.Rapid tests for infection might help detect people, especially health care workers, who are infected yet feel normal. Masks may help. But experts kept returning to social distancing as the single best tool for stopping the chain of transmission in the long term — not lockdowns, necessarily, but canceling mass events, working from home when possible and closing schools.“We can’t assume that any of us are not potential vectors at any time,” Dr. Bergstrom said. “This is why even though I’m feeling great, and have felt great and haven’t been exposed to anybody with any symptoms of anything, that’s why it would be irresponsible of me to go out and about today.”",1
"It’s one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your community. And if you’re like us, you’ve probably been doing it wrong.We asked the experts how to wash our hands. After they taught us the proper technique (above), we had a few more questions:
Will touching the wet faucet really ruin everything?Yes.The faucet may have the same germs you started with! Use a tissue or paper towel to turn it off once your hands are clean. You don’t want to begin again, do you?How hard do I have to scrub?Most people don’t rub vigorously enough, said Barbara Smith, a nurse epidemiologist and infection prevention specialist at Mount Sinai Health Systems in New  York.When you wash your hands, you are using soap and water to physically dislodge germs from your skin and then rinse them away.  
Do I really have to dry my hands all the way?Most people don’t dry thoroughly enough. Germs love moisture. And don’t be afraid to use a little force here too: You are physically removing whatever germs remain.Do I have to use paper towels?No. Cloth towels are fine for personal use, but should be washed every few days — more if multiple people use the same towel. A sick person should use a separate towel. Use paper towels for guests!What about an air dryer?In terms of hygiene, paper towels are best. Hand dryers are OK, so long as you dry your hands thoroughly. There is inconclusive research that suggests a higher germ concentration around some hand dryers, but using a hand dryer is definitely better than wiping your hands on your pants.What’s the best way to know you’ve washed for 20 seconds?One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand.Does it matter what kind of soap I use?Liquid soap is best. Bar soap is fine too, just don’t let it sit around in a gloppy dish. Remember: germs love moisture.When should I be washing my hands?Before you leave the house (to protect others from your germs).And when you arrive at your destination (to wash off germs you’ve picked up from door knobs, elevator buttons, public transportation, etc.)Before and after you eat or prepare food.Before and after you clean your home.After you blow your nose, cough or sneeze.After you use the bathroom or change a diaper.After you feed or touch a pet.What about lotion for dry hands?Yes, but use your own personal supply (most lotion does not contain antibacterial agents, so it should not be shared). And don’t forget to keep the bottle and dispenser clean!Can I still paint my nails?Yes, but it’s best to keep your nails short and your manicure fresh. Germs can live in cracked and chipped polish.What’s the technique with hand sanitizer?Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol, and scrub your hands the same way you would with soap and water. Be sure to use enough liquid so you can reach every surface of your hands.Note: If you’ve seen the recipe circulating on social media for homemade sanitizer using aloe vera gel and rubbing alcohol, we tried it and it didn’t work. You’ll just wind up with a batch of diluted alcohol.Is hand-washing really that important?“Your hands carry almost all your germs to your respiratory tract. Keeping them as clean as possible is really helpful,” said Dr. Adit Ginde, professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “It would dramatically reduce transmission if people did it well.”",1
"Fears about coronavirus have prompted online searches and plenty of misinformation about how to strengthen the immune system. Here’s what works — and what doesn’t.As worries grow about the new coronavirus, online searches for ways to bolster the immune system have surged. Are there foods to boost your immune system? Will vitamins help?The immune system is a complex network of cells, organs and tissues that work in tandem to protect the body from infection. While genetics play a role, we know from studies of twins that the strength of our immune system is largely determined by nonheritable factors. The germs we are exposed to over a lifetime, as well as lifestyle factors like stress, sleep, diet and exercise all play a role in the strength of our immune response.The bottom line is that there is no magic pill or a specific food guaranteed to bolster your immune system and protect you from the new coronavirus. But there are real ways you can take care of yourself and give your immune system the best chance to do its job against a respiratory illness.Lower your stress. Worries about the coronavirus, the stock market and the general disruption of life have added to our stress levels, but we know that stress also can make you more susceptible to respiratory illness.In a series of remarkable studies over 20 years at Carnegie Mellon University, volunteers were exposed to the cold virus (using nose drops) and then quarantined for observation. The researchers found that people who reported less stress in their lives were less likely to develop cold symptoms. Another series of studies at Ohio State University found that marital conflict is especially taxing to the immune system. In a series of studies, the researchers inflicted small wounds on the arms of volunteers, and then asked couples to discuss topics both pleasant and stressful. When couples argued, their wounds took, on average, a full day longer to heal than after the sessions in which the couples discussed something pleasant. Among couples who exhibited especially high levels of hostility, the wounds took two days longer to heal.The bottom line: Your body does a better job fighting off illness and healing wounds when it’s not under stress. Learning techniques for managing stress, like meditation, controlled breathing or talking to a therapist are all ways to help your immune system stay strong.
Improve your sleep habits. A healthy immune system can fight off infection. A sleep-deprived immune system doesn’t work as well. In one surprising study, researchers found 164 men and women willing to be exposed to the cold virus. Not everyone got sick. But short sleepers — those who regularly slept less than six hours a night — were 4.2 times more likely to catch the cold compared with those who got more than seven hours of sleep, researchers found. Risk was even higher when a person slept less than five hours a night.The bottom line: Focusing on better sleep habits is a good way to strengthen your immune system. The sweet spot for sleep is six to seven hours a night. Stick to a regular bedtime and wake-up schedule. Avoid screens, night-eating and exercise right before bedtime.Check your vitamin D level: While more study is needed on the link between vitamin D and immune health, some promising research suggests that checking your vitamin D level — and taking a vitamin D supplement — could help your body fight off respiratory illness. In one study of 107 older patients, some patients took high doses of vitamin D while others were given standard doses. After a year, the researchers found that people in the high-dose group had 40 percent fewer respiratory infections over the course of the year compared to those on the standard dose. A more recent analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials of 11,000 patients showed an overall protective effect of vitamin D supplementation against acute respiratory tract infections. The data aren’t conclusive, and some studies of vitamin D haven’t shown a benefit.Why would vitamin D lower risk for respiratory illness? Our bodies need adequate vitamin D to produce the antimicrobial proteins that kill viruses and bacteria. “If you don’t have adequate vitamin D circulating, you are less effective at producing these proteins and more susceptible to infection,” says Dr. Adit Ginde, professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and the study’s lead author. “These proteins are particularly active in the respiratory tract.”It’s important to note that there are no clinical recommendations to take vitamin D for immune health, although the standard recommendation for bone health is for 600 to 800 international units per day. (That is the level found in most multivitamins.) In the study of respiratory illness and vitamin D, the dose was equivalent to about 3,330 international units daily.Vitamin D can be found in fatty fish, such as salmon, and in milk or foods fortified with vitamin D. In general, our vitamin D levels tend to be influenced by sun exposure, skin tone and latitude — people in northern areas who get less sun exposure in the winter typically have lower vitamin D. A blood test is required to check vitamin D levels. Less than 20 nanograms per milliliter is considered deficient. Above 30 is optimal.The bottom line: If you are concerned about immune health, you may consider having your vitamin D level checked and talking to your doctor about whether to take a supplement.Avoid excessive alcohol consumption. Numerous studies have found a link between excessive alcohol consumption and immune function. Research shows people who drink in excess are more susceptible to respiratory illness and pneumonia and recover from infection and wounds more slowly. Alcohol alters the number of microbes in the gut microbiome, a community of microorganisms that affect the immune system. Excessive alcohol can damage the lungs, and impair the mucosal immune system, which is essential in helping the body recognize pathogens and fight infection. And it’s not just chronic drinking that does damage. Binge drinking can also impair the immune system.The bottom line: A cocktail or glass of wine while you are sheltering in place during coronavirus is fine. But avoid drinking to excess. The current U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that alcohol should be consumed only in moderation — up to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.
Eat a balanced diet, exercise and skip unproven supplements. A healthful diet and exercise are important to maintaining a strong immune system. However, no single food or natural remedy has been proven to bolster a person’s immune system or ward off disease. But that hasn’t stopped people from making specious claims. A recipe circulating on social media claims boiled garlic water helps. Other common foods touted for their immune-boosting properties are ginger, citrus fruits, turmeric, oregano oil and bone broth. There are small studies that suggest a benefit to some of these foods, but strong evidence is lacking. For instance, the bone broth claim has been fueled by a study published in 2000 that showed eating chicken soup seemed to reduce symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. A number of small studies have suggested garlic may enhance immune system function. Claims that elderberry products can prevent viral illness also are making the rounds on social media, but evidence is lacking.Zinc supplements and lozenges are also a popular remedy for fighting off colds and respiratory illness. Some studies have found that zinc lozenges may reduce the duration of cold by about a day and, may reduce the number of upper respiratory infections in children. But the data on zinc are mixed. If you already have enough zinc from your diet, it’s not clear that taking a supplement can help. Zinc supplements also commonly cause nausea.“There are a lot of products that tout immune boosting properties, but I don’t think any of these have been medically proven to work,” said Dr. Krystina Woods, hospital epidemiologist and medical director of infection prevention at Mount Sinai West. “There are people who anecdotally say ‘I felt great after I took’ whatever. That may be true, but there’s no science to support that.”The bottom line: If you enjoy foods touted as immune boosters, there is no harm in eating them as part of a balanced diet. Just be sure that you don’t neglect proven health advice — like washing your hands and not touching your face — when it comes to protecting yourself from viral illness.",1

People who DID NOT have COVID-19 symptoms, but tested positive and have stayed home (home isolated) can leave home under the following conditions:If you have not had a test to determine if you are still contagious, you can leave home after these two things have happened: At least 10 days have passed since the date of your first positive test AND you continue to have no symptoms (no cough or shortness of breath) since the test.If you have had a test to determine if you are still contagious, you can leave home after:You received two negative tests in a row, at least 24 hours apart. Your doctor will follow CDC guidelines.Note: if you develop symptoms, follow guidance above for people with COVID19 symptoms.In all cases, follow the guidance of your doctor and local health department. The decision to stop home isolation should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider and state and local health departments. Some people, for example those with conditions that weaken their immune system, might continue to shed virus even after they recover.",1

"or other non-healthcare settings. Advice for caregivers. If you are caring for someone with COVID-19 at home or in a non-healthcare setting, follow this advice to protect yourself and others. Learn what to do when someone has symptoms of COVID-19. or when someone has been diagnosed with the virus. This information also should be followed when caring for people who have tested positive but are not showing symptoms. Note: Older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for developing more severe illness from COVID-19. People at higher risk of severe illness should call their doctor as soon as symptoms start.prescription bottle alt icon.Provide support and help cover basic needs. Help the person who is sick follow their doctor’s instructions for care and medicine. For most people, symptoms last a few days, and people usually feel better after a week.See if over-the-counter medicines for fever, such as acetaminophen (sometimes called Tylenol), help the person feel better.Make sure the person who is sick drinks a lot of fluids and rests.Help them with grocery shopping, filling prescriptions, and getting other items they may need. Consider having the items delivered through a delivery service, if possible.Take care of their pet(s), and limit contact between the person who is sick and their pet(s) when possible.Watch for warning signs Have their doctor’s phone number on hand.Use CDC’s self-checker tool to help you make decisions about seeking appropriate medical care.

The decision to stop home isolation should be made in consultation with their healthcare provider and state and local health departments. Some people, for example those with conditions that weaken their immune system, might continue to shed virus even after they recover.",1
"How are quarantine and isolation different?Quarantine. Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others. Quarantine helps prevent spread of disease that can occur before a person knows they are sick or if they are infected with the virus without feeling symptoms. People in quarantine should stay home, separate themselves from others, monitor their health, and follow directions from their state or local health department.Isolation. Isolation is used to separate people infected with the virus (those who are sick with COVID-19 and those with no symptoms) from people who are not infected. People who are in isolation should stay home until it’s safe for them to be around others. In the home, anyone sick or infected should separate themselves from others by staying in a specific “sick room” or area and using a separate bathroom (if available).How are quarantine and isolation similar?Both quarantine and isolation: involve separation of people to protect the public. help limit further spread of COVID-19. can be done voluntarily or be required by health authorities. How do I know if I need to be in isolation or quarantine?If you live in a community where COVID-19 is or might be spreading (currently, that is virtually everywhere in the United States). Watch Your Health. Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19.Take your temperature if symptoms develop.Practice social distancing. Maintain 6 feet of distance from others, and stay out of crowded places. Follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop.If you feel healthy but: Recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19. Stay Home and Monitor Your Health. (Quarantine). Stay home until 14 days after your last exposure. Check your temperature twice a day and watch for symptoms of COVID-19.If possible, stay away from people who are at higher-risk for getting very sick from COVID-19.If you: Have been diagnosed with COVID-19, or Are waiting for test results, or Have cough, fever, or shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19.

"It’s one thing to stop touching your face. It’s another to stop touching the things that touch your face.The coronavirus is here, and it’s showing no signs of letting up. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to keep your hands clean and off your face, but it’s hard to maintain constant vigilance.Keeping your phone sanitized is another smart way to keep germs off your fingertips. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers your phone a “high-touch surface,” which could make it a carrier of the virus.But cleaning your phone — thoroughly, I mean — is not as straightforward as it might seem. There are all sorts of nooks and crannies, delicate glass and intricate protective cases.The Don’ts Any sort of moisture can interfere with your phone’s function. Apple recommends that people avoid using spray cleaners or heavy-duty products.No bleach, no aerosol sprays. You need your phone to work, even if you want it clean.Also — and this probably goes without saying — don’t dunk your phone into any sort of liquid, anti-bacterial or otherwise. It won’t end well for either of you.The Dos, A gentle wipe with a product that has 70 percent isopropyl alcohol will do just fine. Apple recommends Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, and the C.D.C. says household disinfectants registered by the Environmental Protection Agency are effective.Wear disposable gloves to clean, the C.D.C. recommends, and wash your hands thoroughly after you’re done. Like your phone, reusable gloves might harbor virus particles, rendering them effectively useless.And don’t forget your phone case.Wipe it down, in and out, through and through. Let it dry before reassembling it.You might also consider changing a bit of your behavior. AT&T suggests sharing photos through texts, instead of passing the phone around, and using devices like headphones and technology like Bluetooth to keep your phone away from your face.Why?This might be the best thing you can do all day. This outbreak is fast-moving and research is, by nature, slow to catch up. As a result, the C.D.C. does not yet know exactly how long the virus can cling to a surface, but evidence suggests it could be “hours to days.”And phones are, well, gross. A 2017 study published in the journal Germs found a host of bacteria, viruses and pathogens on 27 phones owned by teenagers. The scientists wrote that they “hypothesize that this may play a role in the spread of infectious agents in the community.”Safe is always better than sorry.",1
"Can I take my kid to the playground or on the subway? Should my child be tested? We asked experts.Schools across the country have closed in response to the new coronavirus and many parents have questions about how to go about their daily lives while managing their children, whose personal boundaries and hygiene levels are not always ideal.Because the situation is evolving rapidly and the virus is new, the advice may continue to change as we learn more. “We’re not seeing much in the way of serious illness among children,” said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, M.D., Ph.D., the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.On March 18, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new preliminary data on the outcomes of the first 4,226 Americans infected with the new coronavirus, finding no fatalities or admissions to intensive care units among those under 19.Researchers from China published a study online in the journal Pediatrics in March, which examined more than 2,000 children under 18 who either had or were suspected of having Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The researchers found that while the majority of children in the study had either no symptoms, mild symptoms or moderate symptoms, nearly 6 percent became more seriously ill — particularly those under 5. However, it’s unclear if the children with more serious symptoms were sick with Covid-19 or with another respiratory virus, said Dr. Sean O’Leary, M.D., an executive member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases.Still, this study “confirms what we have been suspecting, that it’s almost certainly less severe in children, but it’s not zero,” he said, agreeing that it was prudent for many schools to close. “We’re in the midst of something that no one alive has really experienced before,” he said.With that in mind, here are some answers to common questions.",1
"The situation is changing by the hour, so your best bet is to regularly check your state and local public health department websites for recommendations, Dr. O’Leary said.But as of now, the general advice is to practice social distancing, Dr. Hotez said, which means sticking close to home and avoiding large groups of people. On March 16, the Trump administration announced new guidelines to help stop the spread of the new coronavirus, which included closing schools that were still open and avoiding bars, food courts, restaurants and groups of more than 10 people.You can’t be sure that popular public spaces like playgrounds are risk-free — the virus is estimated to survive on metal, glass and plastic surfaces for anywhere from 2 hours to nine days. New York City, for example, does not regularly clean outdoor furniture and play equipment, said Meghan Lalor, director of media relations at the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. “We have not yet committed to changing our standard operations due to coronavirus, but we will continue to monitor the situation as it develops,” she said. On March 17, all New York City “recreation centers and nature centers are closed to the public until further notice,” Lalor said, though city parks and playgrounds remain open.At this point, some communities are closing their playgrounds; considering school is out and we don’t want children congregating all together, Dr. O’Leary said playgrounds are “probably not the safest place right now.” For city dwellers, he recommended going to big, wide-open parks when available, where kids can stay practice physical distancing and not touch equipment. Remember there are other options for solo outdoor play, like riding on a scooter or a bike. There are also options for indoor movement — for example, there are kids’ yoga videos all over YouTube that you and your family can enjoy together.As always, encourage hand washing when children come in from outside and before and after meals. Kids should sing “Happy Birthday” twice to know how long to wash their hands, and then make sure they are drying them thoroughly. There’s some evidence that paper towels are more hygienic than hand dryers in public bathrooms. Hand washing is also more effective than hand sanitizer, though hand sanitizer can be used when hand washing is not an option.",1
"“We’re really encouraging zero play dates at this point,” said Dr. O’Leary.  Theoretically, he said, it might be feasible for your child to play outside with one other child if they can keep six feet apart, but the reality is that keeping younger kids from touching their friends is nearly impossible. If you have an older child who you know can absolutely stay six feet apart from his pals in a wide open space, it’s fine for them to play, but monitor them closely. Always make sure they are washing hands vigorously when they come inside.",1
"Recipes for homemade hand sanitizer are circulating online, but none of the experts I spoke to recommended making your own, even if stores have run out. Many popular brands of hand sanitizer, like Purell or Highmark, have established concentrations of alcohol, generally between 60 and 95 percent, said Dr. Rebecca Pellett Madan, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist at N.Y.U. Langone’s Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital, which helps ensure their effectiveness. Additionally, she said, “we have experience using it in hospitals, and we know how effective it is.” The same evidence base for homemade recipes doesn’t exist yet.
If you are using store-bought hand sanitizer, make sure that it’s at least 60 percent alcohol and that it fully dries before you or your child touch anything — otherwise it won’t work as well. Also keep in mind that hand sanitizers are not as effective when used on “visibly dirty or greasy” hands, according to the C.D.C.",1
"No. Coronavirus symptoms can include fever, dry cough or shortness of breath. If your child has other symptoms, like mild fever, runny nose or sore throat, you should call your pediatrician first before going anywhere. “We want people who are not critically ill to stay out of the hospital,” Dr. Madan said.
If your child develops more severe symptoms, such as trouble breathing, an inability to eat or drink or a change in behavior, you should visit a doctor, Dr. Madan said.",1
"Unless your child has a history of direct contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus, a history of travel to affected areas or is sick enough to be hospitalized, it is unlikely she will be tested.“Availability of testing depends on where you are,” Dr. O’Leary said. “Even in the best case scenario, you can’t test everyone because there aren’t enough test kits at this point.” Older and higher-risk patients are being prioritized for testing because they tend to develop the most severe symptoms after infection.If your child does get tested, it’s unclear how quickly her results will come back — and the time frame will most likely depend on where you are, which lab is testing her and how long she’s been sick. “It’s all over the map,” Dr. O’Leary said. Anecdotally, he has heard about results taking anywhere from a few hours to seven days, depending on the state and the level of demand.A greater number of labs will be able to provide testing in the coming days, according to Dr. O’Leary. But because there may also be increased demand, it’s unclear whether that will speed up testing time overall.",1
"If you have a newborn, toddler or young child who is still receiving immunizations, it is important to take her to her well visit, as long as you can do it safely, according to new guidance released from the A.A.P. on March 18. “We don’t want those kids to miss their vaccines,” Dr. O’Leary said. “Then we’ll have unprotected infants,” who will be susceptible to other diseases. Your child’s first newborn visit to a pediatrician is particularly important, Dr. O’Leary said, as your doctor will want to check her weight, test for jaundice and help troubleshoot any breastfeeding issues.If your child is older and has received all of her immunizations, the A.A.P. recommends that you consider postponing your well visit for the near term. The organization also has tips for doctors to help keep their patients, parents and staff safe during their visits, including keeping well visits in the morning and restricting visits for kids who are sick to the afternoon. It also urges doctors to see kids who are sick in different facilities, rooms or floors, and to increase the use of telemedicine.",1
"You can wash bedsheets and towels more often. Jolie Kerr, a cleaning expert and frequent New York Times contributor, said that you could also wash stuffed animals more often (here’s how) and clean hard toys with antibacterial wipes regularly — particularly after outdoor use.",1
"Older adults, especially those who have compromised immune systems, seem to be the most vulnerable to the new coronavirus. Some areas are calling for  extreme measures: For example, California called for people over 65 to stay in their homes, while New York state is asking those over 70 to stay indoors.  
If possible, grandparents should not visit their grandchildren right now. “It appears that children and young adults are an important vector for coronavirus, because they may be infectious even if they don’t have symptoms,” Dr. Cynthia R. Ambler, M.D., a pediatrician at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago told Hallie Levine in a piece for the Times addressing the safety of grandparents. If grandparents are the primary caretakers of children, kids and grandparents alike should wash hands even more carefully and regularly disinfect frequently touched surfaces.",1
"Pushing a shopping cart, braving crowded aisles and even unpacking bags feel perilous. Here’s our guide to shopping during the coronavirus crisis.As much of the world practices social distancing to stop the spread of coronavirus, trips to the grocery store are one of the few reasons many of us still are allowed to leave the house.But the logistics of shopping for groceries can be daunting. What happens if some key items on my shopping list are sold out? How do I keep my distance in a crowded produce aisle? And just how many people have touched that jar of peanut butter or can of beans we brought home?We talked to infectious disease experts about how to shop for groceries during the coronavirus crisis. Here’s their advice.Check store policies. Look online for what your store is doing to protect both customers and workers. Many stores now close early to sanitize and offer dedicated shopping hours to customers who are 60 and older. Some stores have installed wipe and hand sanitizer stations and put colored tape on floors to help customers keep their distance at checkout lines. If your store isn’t taking special measures, don’t shop there.Should I wear a mask and gloves? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends wearing a face covering or homemade mask in public spaces. Gloves are not recommended or necessary if you wash your hands after shopping. Don’t let wearing a mask give you a 0 sense of security. You should still limit trips to the store, avoid touching your face and wash your hands when you get home.Bring your own wipes and sanitizer. “Most stores are providing hand sanitizer wipes, but I encourage people to bring some of their own — some stores have run out,” said Dr. Elizabeth Eckstrom, professor and chief of geriatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. “When you finish shopping, wipe your hands again and wipe the handles of your car before getting in. I am also wiping my steering wheel, but that might be going overboard.”Wipe the shopping cart. Even during the best of times, the handle on your shopping cart has more bacteria than most public restrooms. When researchers in 2012 swabbed the handles of 85 shopping carts in Iowa, California, Oregon and Georgia, they found digestive tract bacteria on 73 percent of the carts. If you can, wipe down the cart handle and child seat before you shop. And when you leave, do a good deed and wipe your cart handle for the next shopper.What if I don’t have wipes? Don’t freak out if you or your store have run out of wipes. “The risk of becoming infected from touching any individual shopping cart is probably very, very low,” said Dr. Daniel Winetsky, infectious diseases fellow at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “So if wipes are not available, there is no need to abandon your grocery shopping needs. Just try not to touch your face while shopping, and wash your hands or use hand sanitizer after you are done.”Shop early. Most stores are closing early now to restock and sanitize at night. Try to shop early when stores are cleanest and shelves are full, or shop at off-peak hours when stores are less crowded.Keep your distance. It’s probably not feasible to keep a six-foot radius at all times in a grocery store, but try for at least three feet, as recommended by the World Health Organization. “The majority of respiratory droplets we produce while breathing and talking fall to the ground — and onto our hands — within a few feet from us, so even a little bit of distance helps,” Dr. Winetsky said.Limit your trips to the store. Most people don’t have the freezer space or the funds to stock up on two weeks of groceries. But try to get enough food so you don’t have to shop more than once a week. “Every trip to the grocery store is a small exposure event,” said Dr. Robert Amler, dean of New York Medical College School of Health Sciences and Practice and a former chief medical officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “You don’t want to do it too often or spend too much time there.”Have a flexible plan. To minimize your time in the store, have a shopping list that allows for alternatives. Don’t fret if your store has run out of chicken or salmon fillets. Just find a substitute protein — other meats, eggs, tofu, canned tuna, beans — and move on.Shop for long-lasting foods. Frozen fruits and vegetables are great to have in a pinch, but you can also buy longer-lasting fresh produce. Root vegetables such as potatoes or carrots, as well as squash, onions, celery, apples or oranges, can last for weeks. Taste of Home has a useful guide on how long fruits and vegetables will keep. Regular yogurt, hard cheese and nondairy milk can last a while. Whole-wheat tortillas can be frozen and are a great substitute for sandwich bread, which takes up more space in the freezer.Don’t hoard. Panic-buying has prompted some people to fight over toilet paper and pilfer from others’ shopping carts. Take what you need for the week; leave food for others. Be reassured that while there may be some empty shelves and temporary shortages of some items, food makers are confident in the supply chain and that we’ll have plenty to eat.Really, really don’t touch your face. We know it’s hard, but if there ever was a time to not touch your face, it’s in a grocery store filled with people touching everything before you put it in your cart. Sanitize your hands while shopping and after touching high-contact areas like freezer doors. “Absolutely don’t touch your face,"" said Dr. Amler. “Don’t touch your mouth, don’t touch your eyes, don’t rub your nose until you’ve been able to sanitize your hands.”Be kind to your checkout person. Try to maintain a reasonable distance at checkout. If paying with cash, set the money on the counter rather than handing it to the cashier. And given that this is an opportunity for in-person social interaction, try to make the most of it and be friendly. “Try to maintain distance at checkout, but be pleasant and supportive,” Dr. Amler said. “There is a risk to them, being in that environment all the time. You might want to thank them for working during this hectic period.”
Is self-checkout better? Dr. Winetsky noted that at self-checkout, you’re trading an interaction with one person for a self-checkout surface that has been touched by many, many people before you. Either way, wash your hands afterward.Reusable bags are still OK, but check with your store. A report from Loma Linda University noted that bacteria could persist on and in reusable checkout bags, but this is not a reason to stop using them. Wash and wipe bags when you can, and wash your hands after using them. Offer to pack your own groceries to protect the checkout person from your germs, said Dr. Eckstrom. That said, some stores may have a policy against bringing reusable bags.Dr. Winetsky agreed that the risk of infection from reusable bags is low, and noted that using them not only helps the environment but can serve as a reminder of the link between the environment and our health. “We should all be bringing reusable grocery bags to reduce our carbon footprint and lower our impact on the environment,” he said. “This may seem like an unrelated idea, but deforestation can play a role in the emergence of pandemic viruses, by bringing humans into closer contact with mammal species from which we were previously very isolated.”Should I wipe jars and plastic containers when I get home? The majority of transmission of coronavirus is likely from close contact with an infected person. Viral particles do not survive well on paper or cardboard surfaces. And while the virus lasts longer on hard surfaces, contamination from jars and plastic containers is not a big risk. If it makes you feel better, Dr. Amler said, give them a quick wipe as you unpack.Dr. Winetsky agreed that the risk of contamination from jars, cans or other containers “is infinitesimally small” and that you have to balance risk with anxiety. “I would not do this myself or really recommend it to other people,” he said. “This level of anxiety about sanitation can be harmful in and of itself.”What about produce? Dr. Eckstrom advised washing your hands after unpacking groceries. And if you’re going to eat raw produce, she recommends washing it with an organic soap for washing vegetables or any natural dish soap.“I am not wiping everything down, but I am carefully washing my hands after touching these grocery items,” said Dr. Eckstrom. “Cooking does kill the virus, but any fresh produce that is eaten raw should be carefully washed.”Don’t stress. While it’s smart to take precautions, you also need to take care of your mental health and try to minimize the anxiety of shopping during the pandemic. “Be reasonable with yourself,” Dr. Amler said. “Don’t overly stress. Do the best you can, and most of the time you’re going to come out OK.”",1

"There is no evidence yet that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can gain entrance through the eye. However, there are now reports of the virus being present in tears and on the surface of the eye. While most of those patients were very ill, it is likely that the surface of the eye and its tears may contain virus and it’s best to avoid touching the eye or tears of any potential patient.While we do not yet have any direct evidence that the virus is infectious if it touches the eye, we must assume that it is a possibility. As the general precautions all stress, anyone who touches someone who may be infected (or something they may have touched) should wash their hands immediately, and refrain from touching their own face (which would include the mouth and nose—known sites of infection—as well as the eyes).Alfred Sommer, MD, MHS, is a professor of Ophthalmology and Epidemiology and Dean Emeritus of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

"For people with diabetes, factors that potentially play a role in increasing their risk of developing a more serious case of COVID-19 include:The presence of chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and obesity that also increase the risk for COVID-19. Impaired function of white blood cells that fight infection, and an exaggerated inflammatory response by the body toward the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Increased expression of an enzyme (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) in the lungs, heart, kidneys, and pancreas that acts as a portal for the novel coronavirus to enter human cells. To stay healthy, optimal diabetes management is important, including controlling blood pressure and cholesterol levels. People with diabetes should stay hydrated, carefully record blood glucose and ketone readings, and—if a person develops symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath—contact their health care provider immediately.Ranganath Muniyappa, MD, PhD, is a senior research physician at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health. He published “COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses, and diabetes mellitus,” on March 31, 2020, in the American Journal of Physiology. ",1
"Two main clues help us predict whether a virus is going to stick around. First, we consider the virus’s origins. If it came from animals and could still be circulating in animals, then no matter how good we are at getting rid of it in humans, animals could always bring it back. That’s true with influenza: Even if a certain strain disappears, a new one might emerge from animals—as we’ve seen with avian viruses.But with a major outbreak like COVID-19 already underway in humans, the big question is how good humans are at developing immunity. And, if they gain immunity, does it stick, or does it fizzle out over time—leaving the door open a crack for the virus to return? As the first cases get further and further out from the point of infection, that data will give us a better idea of what to expect.",1
"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with respiratory tissue damage that can impair lung function and even cause death. Though it is likely that both the virus and immune system contribute to this process, it can be difficult to determine which mechanism causes the most damage.To establish infection, a virus must enter a host cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell’s machinery to replicate, eventually killing the cell and releasing more virus. This process not only damages host tissues, but also potently activates the immune system. The immune system in turn unleashes powerful weapons to control the infection. However, if not carefully regulated, the immune response itself can cause collateral damage to host tissues and exacerbate disease severity.More research on the host and viral factors that contribute to severe COVID-19 disease and death could provide important clues for clinicians and researchers in the search for new treatments.",1
"The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 will likely continue with minimal variation. It will probably stay stable because very few people are immune—so many “naïve” human hosts are still available for maintaining current transmission cycles.This virus appears very balanced in terms of transmission-to-virulence. It also can be transmitted early in infection. Serious disease usually doesn’t occur until much later—and by that time, many patients are confined to a hospital bed. Consequently, a long transmission window is present before a person falls seriously ill, giving the virus plenty of time to spread. Selection is heavily driven by transmissibility, and the role of virulence in this process is much less clear.Another coronavirus, MERS, has a high lethality but doesn’t transmit as easily. This one is far more virulent—and devastating. Many dangerous respiratory viruses spread efficiently before causing severe disease—and that’s what we’re seeing with SARS-CoV-2.",1
"It is likely that eventually it will become endemic, and most of us will get infected. But one question is super important: How long will it take for that to happen? If it happens in a few months, every hospital will be overwhelmed and people will not be treated for coronavirus or other diseases. If it happens that fast, it will be an unprecedented disaster. However, if we do our best in terms of prevention by practicing social distancing, reducing travel, not going to work when we’re sick, we could slow spread of the disease. If the same 60-70% infection of the global population is spread over 3 years, then hospitals don’t get overwhelmed, people can get treated, and we have time to develop a vaccine—it’s a completely different story.The difference between it happening fast or slow is potentially the difference between a 1918 flu level event and a bad flu season level event. We have control over that.",1
"When a virus passes from a nonhuman animal into a human, we call that moment of spillover a zoonotic transmission. It’s an ecological event. What happens next depends on evolutionary potential and chance. If the virus is adaptable, it may succeed in replicating and proliferating in the new human host. Maybe it kills the person and the line of transmission comes to an end there—as happens with rabies. But if the virus is even more adaptable, it may acquire the ability to pass from one human host to another, perhaps by sexual contact (as with HIV), perhaps in bodily fluids such as blood (as with Ebola), perhaps in respiratory droplets launched by coughing or sneezing (as with influenza or SARS). What makes a virus adaptable? The changeability of its genome, plus Darwinian natural selection. Those viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes, which replicate themselves inaccurately and therefore have highly changeable genomes, are among the most adaptable. Coronaviruses belong to that group.",1
"COVID-19 doesn’t pose any known risk to blood donors during the donation process or from attending blood drives.Blood donation is a highly regulated, safe process—and most centers have implemented additional precautions including increased sanitation of donor areas, use of PPE, and social distancing to enhance their already-healthy environments. Additionally, since donors must be healthy on donation day, risk of exposure to sick individuals is extremely low.While donors may worry that they could be infected but asymptomatic, respiratory viruses are not generally thought to be transmitted by blood transfusion. There are no reported cases to date of transfusion transmission of COVID-19.Even during a shelter-in-place, people still require critical medical care. They will continue to be in car crashes, need emergency organ transplants and chemotherapy, and give birth to babies in critical condition. The need for blood is constant, and we continue to rely on blood donors’ generosity. ",1
"Viral load refers to the amount of virus detected in a sample, such as blood if the virus is present in blood, or the lungs if they can be sampled, and most commonly in nasal swabs taken for diagnosis. It is a quantitative measure of how much virus there is in a particular body fluid or site.  Certainly the higher the viral load the greater the risk of transmission to an uninfected person.  But transmission is a complex process and the amount of virus a person is exposed to is only one variable. While viral load can affect the risk of becoming infected, it is not typically associated with a more severe outcome of infection. That is determined by how well the virus replicates in the infected person, their general state of health, and perhaps genetic factors and unknown factors that change risk.",1
"Reinfection is always a possibility with a viral infection, particularly if you have a subclinical infection and don’t mount much of an immune response against it. Reinfection is also possible within the window after the first infection and before you develop antibodies. That window can vary from a couple of weeks to a few months, depending on how much your immune system was triggered.We’ve now got a good population of people who have recovered from the virus. Serum samples from those patients can allow us to time exactly when they begin to develop antibodies and when they develop sufficient titers and neutralizing antibodies. This will help us determine what the window is for protection.Before your immune system returns to normal, you can be infected by not just this virus, but by regular colds and flu. A couple of months may be a reasonable window of recovery, based on what we know right now.",1
"Cash can be contaminated with potential bacterial pathogens, but there is little information about viruses on cash in general—and nothing about contamination with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.SARS-CoV-2 is spread by person-to-person contact—not normally by touching fomites (objects that may be contaminated with, and help transmit, infectious organisms) like cash. And, it’s unclear how long COVID-19 remains viable on surfaces—ranging from a few minutes to hours to potentially days depending on the temperature, humidity and surface type. Switching from cash to plastic has not been proven more protective, either, except perhaps by reducing person-to person hand exposure.Some countries are washing or disinfecting cash, but there is no data demonstrating how this process works. The best practice is social distancing: limiting person-to-person contact by shutting down schools, bars, and other crowded places. That is what will slow infections, prevent health care systems from overloading, and reduce deaths. That is why everyone should do their part and embrace social distancing rather than worrying about using money or credit cards.",1
"Cryptic transmission is the term that is used when there is no direct contact between person 1 shedding the virus and person 2 contracting it.It is an important indicator of community prevalence of a virus. There is essentially enough circulating virus in a community to transmit the same strain of the virus between individuals who are not directly linked.In the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, this term came into the lexicon after University of Washington researchers sequenced the COVID-19 genome from Snohomish County, Washington, which showed a direct genetic link from the first 2 cases in Washington though they had no known contact. This indicated there was significant community spread, and likely evidence the virus had been circulating for weeks by that point. As I noted on Twitter, the key takeaway is this is going to be a critical path for viral transmission given the potential infectivity prior to the manifestation of symptoms—and what will ultimately make it so hard to control the spread of the virus.",1
"The symptoms of COVID-19—including fever, cough, and difficulty breathing—are similar to those of other cold and flu viruses. At this moment, the decision to test for COVID-19 in the US depends on both the patient’s clinical status and what is happening in a particular geographic location. A history of travel, especially international travel to one of the most affected areas, is still important, but this is evolving as the outbreak develops domestically. Close contact with someone who traveled to those areas or with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 are other considerations.The evaluation of cold and flu symptoms will often include testing for routine respiratory viruses as well, especially influenza. In general, if you do not have symptoms and would not ordinarily seek medical care based on how you feel now, you do not need evaluation or testing for COVID-19.",1
"Infection rate and progression to severe disease in pregnant women is similar to that in nonpregnant adult women. The same protective measures against transmission of the virus apply to both.So far, no transmission from mother to fetus has been described. Vaginal delivery should be encouraged when both the mother and the baby are not severely sick. Strict protective measures (facemasks, hand hygiene) must be observed to protect the newborn and the personnel during and after childbirth.Separation of the mother and baby and breastfeeding should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the mother. The newborn should be protected from infection by the mother as much as possible. If the mother wishes to express her milk or breastfeed, disinfection of the breast should be added to the protection methods mentioned above.We have launched an international registry for women exposed to COVID-19 and welcome any medical center and maternity to join. (If you are a patient interested in sharing your data, please suggest that your doctors contact Dr. Baud.)",1
"Although it’s possible we could have pre-existing immunity if we were previously infected with “common cold” coronaviruses, there is no evidence that this is protective in people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).Unless I see data otherwise, I’d assume that most of us are immunologically “naive.” However, although we don’t know if it’s relevant to COVID-19 epidemiology, it has been shown that antibodies against SARS-CoV can block infection of cells with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, so there is the possibility of protective cross-reactive immunity from closely related coronaviruses.",1
"Every virus has its unique challenges. In the case of n-coronavirus, the vaccine challenges are 2-fold. First, you have to interfere with the virus’s ability to dock with a specific receptor in the lungs called ACE2. Then, you need to reduce the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement. ADE means that some respiratory virus vaccines can actually make things worse. There are multiple ways to solve this problem. One option is creating a vaccine that only uses parts of the pathogen to stimulate the immune system. One approach is to do this by producing recombinant protein subunit vaccines. We have found that these vaccines that use a part of a protein of the virus (the spike protein) and known as the receptor binding domain (RBD) are optimal for 2 reasons: Recombinant proteins are a standard technology that has resulted in other licensed vaccines, including the hepatitis B and HPV vaccines; and it’s possible to produce this vaccine in abundance and at low cost. Moreover, this approach, unlike many others, reduces ADE and has a potential for being safe. ",1
"“We are learning more about the virus every day. On the continuum of the common cold to SARS, it’s now clear that the novel coronavirus is more contagious than SARS, but less deadly. We don’t yet know how much more contagious, or how much less deadly. The number of confirmed infections with nCoV has already far outpaced the total number of suspected SARS cases.”",1
"Contract tracing is a core public health function that public health agencies have done for years. Diagnostic tests can confirm whether a person is infected with an illness. Contact tracing involves finding out who the infected person had contacts with so that those individuals can be alerted that they are at a risk of developing the illness and at risk of potentially infecting others in the community.During contact tracing, the contacts of the infected person are generally called up, asked if they're feeling sick, and advised to self-quarantine for a period of time. During the quarantine period, the health of the contacts can be monitored and health care or other services could be provided to them if they do develop symptoms. Also, it is important to make sure that people who have been exposed to the illness are not circulating in the community and further spreading the disease.",1
"This pandemic will last until most people are immune, whether through vaccination or from having gotten the illness [COVID-19] and recovered. The 18-month figure comes from reports that we won’t have a vaccine in less than 18 months, but that would be in unprecedented, in record-breaking time. We’ll eventually have a vaccine, but that may be in 18 months or 5 years from now.I think there will be waves of the epidemic across the US. What’s happening now in Seattle and New York, and to a lesser extent in San Francisco, will happen in Baltimore and Dallas at different times. Each wave will last a couple of months—from valley to peak to valley. As we begin to relax social distancing efforts—which we will have to do because society can’t stay like this—the disease will start to come back. The hope is that it will return more slowly because there are fewer susceptible hosts, we’ll have more ubiquitous testing, and more [targeted] interventions instead of the sledgehammer we’re using now.",1
"There is already evidence of widening transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across the Southern Hemisphere, though the virus is currently taking its primary toll in the North. It is likely that 60-65% of Northern Hemisphere populations will be infected with the virus by July or August.As the epidemics seem to diminish later in the summer, action will shift to the South, with COVID-19 sweeping across Latin America, Africa and the South Pacific, similarly infecting upwards of 60% of populations. And then by December, it will make a slow return to the Northern Hemisphere, creating a North/South cycle that will persist for years.Adding additional fuel to the South’s fire will be high HIV infection rates, with more than a third of HIV-infected Africans, in particular, unaware of their status and therefore not on suppressive medication, and immunocompromised.",1
"Mortality rates will vary by country according to several factors. First, it will depend on the age structure of the population; Italy has the second oldest population in the world, which  may partly explain the high mortality observed.Health care availability (in terms of the number of hospital and intensive care beds) and accessibility (free versus paid) will also influence mortality. For example, low death rates in Germany and South Korea are partially attributed to the relatively high number of hospital beds per capita. Moreover, disparities in death rates between Hubei province—the location of Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged—and other parts of China are thought to be due to the rapid case rise and resulting strain on health care resources in Hubei.Lastly, a country’s testing policy will be an important determining factor. If there is widespread testing of community as well as hospital-based cases, mortality will be lower than if testing was solely focused on hospital cases.",1
"The word pandemic literally means “all people” in Greek. But clearly not all people become sick even in the worst pandemics. Epidemiologists typically mean an infectious disease epidemic that has spread or is spreading globally.Usually we refer to a pandemic only when it involves a new disease. So, for example, we talk about an influenza pandemic when there is a new strain of flu spreading around the world. In contrast, we do not refer to the global outbreak of seasonal influenza as a pandemic because the strains are not new.
There is no strict definition of when an epidemic becomes a pandemic—but usually it means that the disease is actively spreading on several continents with likely continued spread to other continents.",1
"About 60% of newly emerged and re-emerging pathogens share a common origin: the bodies of animals. Genetic and epidemiological evidence suggest that the novel coronavirus, like SARS, may have emerged from a so-called “wet market,” where wild species that would rarely encounter each other in nature are crammed together, allowing microbes to spread between species and into humans. China claimed to have cracked down on these markets after the SARS outbreak, but when I visited a few years later, it wasn’t hard to find one. But such markets are only part of the problem. The loss of wildlife habitat around the world more generally is forcing wild species to cram into closer proximity to human settlements. Bats, for example, have been fingered as the source of Ebola, SARS, and a host of other pathogens. When we cut down the forests where they live, they come roost in our backyards and farms instead. It’s this kind of novel, intimate contact that provides opportunities for the microbes that live in their bodies to spread into ours.",1
"Once two or more people are identified, disease detectives (such as those in the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service) look for what these people have in common. Do they live together? Work together? Shop at the same market? Points of overlap could indicate sources of the pathogen.At the same time, infectious disease doctors and scientists try figure out what the pathogen is. In the case of the novel coronavirus, scientists isolated and genetically sequenced the virus, revealing its close relationship to SARS, which originated in bats but was transmitted to humans through another species.Pinpointing the precise animal species will take time and a lot of testing: It took more than a year to identify civets as the intermediary host between bats and humans for SARS.",1
"Rather than using the term super spreaders (a person who infects a large number of people), we should think of them as super spreading events. Maybe a person is at the right time of infection and at the mall. Typhoid Mary infected many people because she was a cook.Part of the reason we stopped SARS is that a lot of super spreading was happening in health care settings and when people really got their act together in terms of infection control and biocontainment, it nipped the epidemic in the bud.Super spreading events have the largest influence an outbreak’s trajectory early on. If there’s only a few cases and one person then infects 10 others, it can make it start strong. Once an epidemic gets going and has 100 to 200 cases or more, the “law of large numbers” takes over—and it stops mattering so much.",1
"The reproductive number represents the average number of people that one infected person will infect. The reproductive number for a disease can change based on how infectious the pathogen is, the host population, and environmental factors.To control an outbreak, the goal is to reduce a disease’s reproductive number to less than 1. If the reproductive number remains 1 or higher, the outbreak will continue. In the case of COVID-19, the estimated reproductive number is around 2.6, meaning the outbreak is expected to continue.The reproductive number can be reduced by altering transmission dynamics—with social distancing, home isolation, quarantine, and use of personal protective equipment in health care settings. Over time as people are infected and recover—or if a vaccine becomes available (which may take months or years)—immunity in the population also reduces the effective reproductive number of a disease.",1
"When you think of containing an epidemic, from Ebola to coronavirus, labs and disease surveillance are often top of mind. Risk communications, however, is a key aspect in shaping the course of an epidemic, and how prepared people are to combat it.People need timely, accurate and easy-to-understand information that encourages protective behavior without inciting panic. Information based on the changing risk of transmission and not politics, fear or stigma is critical.As coronavirus spreads, government, media and others need to elevate accurate information sources and built community trust while combatting misinformation.",1
"Data transparency and political sensitivity are two of the most critical challenges to effective global cooperation on the COVID-19 outbreak—and they are deeply entwined.China has a history of concealing, delaying or refusing to share data and information (this happened with SARS in 2002-2003 and in 2018, when China reportedly refused to share samples of a bird flu with pandemic potential). Leading global health agencies have praised China’s response to COVID-19, while other experts doubt the accuracy of the reported data. Data transparency is key to building much-needed trust—and preventing the misallocation of resources, which could slow the response.Some countries in Asia—where China holds significant economic and political influence—have carefully crafted their public coronavirus responses, aware that criticizing China could hinder cooperation. And all stakeholders face a difficult task: balancing effective disease response with the political sensitivity necessary for a successful, cooperative, global response.",1
"The likelihood of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) through export goods originating from China or elsewhere is quite low. Although SARS-CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from 2 hours to 9 days, it is vulnerable to heat, changes in pH, and common disinfectants.  Since SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus (meaning it has a fragile outer layer), it is less stable and more susceptible to disinfectants. Therefore, the risk of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low—and so is the risk of catching the disease from a package that has been transported and exposed to different conditions (and temperatures).So, feel free to order that dress from China or those leather shoes from Italy. While you are at it, wash your hands and maybe wipe the surface with a disinfectant because informed preventive measures are what we need to stop both COVID-19 and the fear epidemic from spreading.",1
"It really is best to limit interactions as much as we can, and arranging play dates is generally not a good idea. Every time we get together with another person we’re not just exposed to each other—we’re also exposed to all of the other people that they have come into contact with. If you really need the help, arrange play dates safely by asking your friends and family to keep their circle of contacts small. As a guideline, keep play dates between no more than 2 families. I have a 1-year-old, and I’m trying to go for lots of walks with him. We go to the park, but we don’t play on the equipment any longer—instead I let him run around in the field as much as he wants. We keep our distance from other people, but we say hello from afar and kick a ball around instead. ",1
"Health care workers are always very aware of the risks they face at work while caring for patients.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increased vigilance in health care settings to prevent infection of patients and health care workers.  Hospital infection control programs are charged with protecting our health care workforce and the patient populations we serve every single day. For protection against COVID infection, meticulous attention to hand hygiene, routine face masking and social distancing also apply in the health care setting.  In addition, health care workers are trained in the proper use and disposal of personal protective equipment and potentially contaminated materials, instructed not to come to work when sick, and if sick, are prioritized for COVID-19 testing.
With the appropriate attention to infection prevention practices that every health care facility must practice, health care workers do not pose an increased risk to the community than the public at-large.We are all paying close attention to practices to protect ourselves, our families, and our communities while caring for patients during this challenging time.",1
"The majority of the transmission is happening through respiratory droplets that we may inhale from close contact with one another. To avoid crowds, be strategic about the time and the day of week that you go out to get food. Even now, shopping centers get busier on weekends. If the store is crowded, try again later.  
As the CDC recommends, unless you’re treating a patient, use a homemade face cover when you go out in public. Medical masks must be saved for health workers who need them desperately. Also, use hand sanitizer or wash your hands as soon as possible after returning from the grocery store. If you decide to wear gloves, treat them like you would your bare hands. Immediately dispose of the gloves after an activity, and then wash your hands. And, if you receive take-out at home, have it left at the door to help protect delivery people, who are doing a great service for us.",1

"The development of vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 share common goals: to ensure safety and efficacy. These are often assessed through a series of studies, sometimes beginning with animal experiments, progressing through human phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials with increasing numbers of participants. However, it often takes much longer to develop and rigorously assess a vaccine. First, vaccines are usually targeted to healthy people, in contrast to drugs administered to people with disease. Larger and longer studies are often needed to ensure the safety of vaccines. Second, the outcomes of interest often take much longer to be measured. Vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity can take many months to measure accurately, whereas whether or not a treated patient improves can take days. And some vaccines require multiple doses spread out over months whereas drug treatment regimens typically are days to weeks. Once developed, it can also take longer to manufacture and deploy vaccines.",1
"WHO has reiterated to all countries that with early and aggressive measures, they can stop transmission and save lives. WHO must be the first entry point for reliable information on the virus and its spread. It also has the unique mandate to provide evidence-based guidance to help countries and individuals to assess and manage their risk and make decisions. This is even more critical now as countries should be preparing for sustained community transmission.WHO must also be able to support the most vulnerable countries.The world requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach as outlined in the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan that WHO has issued: Establishing international coordination and operational support; scaling up country readiness and response operations; and accelerating priority research and innovation.That turns the question on its head: One of the most important things countries and financial organizations must now do is support WHO in order to protect us all.",1
"Preparedness starts with funding. That’s how everything else gets done—by having resources available to prepare for these kinds of rare but highly impactful events.

Public health departments would use that money to ensure expertise in emergency and pandemic planning. That’s key not only for the public health preparedness, but for preparedness in hospitals and long-term care facilities as well.

The money could also be used for supplies. In the US, we’ve heard a lot of about the Strategic National Stockpile which contains critical medicines and supplies needed during public health disasters. Having the resources to ensure we have extra supplies on hand is crucial.

Preparedness also means having policies and guidance ready to pull off the shelf during crises, rather than starting from scratch. That could include telework policies at an institutional level, or advance thinking on actions like the triggers that would indicate a need to close or reopen schools.",1
"Even without approved treatments, there are several key ways health care providers can care for people with COVID-19 and keep them alive:Control their symptoms: Give them medications that make having COVID-19 more tolerable—ones that control fever, cough, and other commonly associated symptoms. Provide intensive support to the body of a sick person as their immune system battles the infection: We see that some patients may become critically ill with this disease, hence they may need mechanical ventilation or urgent dialysis. There may be a role for technologies such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to help their lungs recover from acute respiratory distress syndrome.Treat other infections that COVID-19 patients may get, such as concurrent bacterial pneumonia because their lungs are not functioning as well as they can. In this case, clinicians will use antibiotics to help them recover.",1
"The CDC believes it is likely that COVID-19 will cause a pandemic, but there are steps that the public can take to protect and prepare themselves.First, it is important to stay informed and follow instructions issued by your local or state health department and the CDC. Basic infection control measures still apply in this scenario. Practicing good handwashing techniques or using hand sanitizer, avoiding people who are ill, and staying home when you are sick are all effective measures.A pandemic could interrupt supply chains and result in closures at local businesses, meaning it may be prudent to stock reserves of critical supplies. Examples include extra prescription medications, asthma relief inhalers, over-the-counter anti-fever and pain medications, non-perishable food items, household cleaning supplies, and toiletries. However, do not hoard - this could create shortages.",1
"Consider the limitations or strain already on health systems in many of the countries where global health programs operate. Whether related to health services, surveillance, or supply chains, meeting public demand can be an ongoing challenge at baseline. To add an outbreak response in those settings could spur an outright collapse of essential resources. And that could have a ripple effect for people in need of care across a range of issues, not only those exposed to a novel disease.Consider a woman who can no longer visit a local clinic to protect her from pregnancy complications. Or the person living with HIV, TB, or some other chronic condition who can no longer receive lifesaving medications, either because of a breakdown or diversion of the pipeline intended to provide those. Furthermore, these very populations are at greater risk of poor outcomes from a disease like COVID-19, creating a potentially vicious cycle.That is why it's essential that policymakers and practitioners shore up resources that protect progress in other critical areas of global health, while preventing fallout from a new public health enemy. If we are vigilant, we can soften the blow.",1
"Today’s communication environment is a sea of rapidly changing “information,” confusion and distrust. Events shift rapidly, and conflicting perspectives, opinions and statements and accusations of “fake news” are common. Science-based information, when inconvenient, can be contested as just another perspective while repetition is used to establish “facts.” In this environment, presenting public health information so it is trusted, understood and acted upon is difficult but possible.
Trust is built over time. Establish credibility by being a reliable source over time so when a crisis occurs, people will turn to you.
Focus on what people want to know; not just on what you want to communicate. One person’s important facts can be irrelevant to others.
Make information accessible. Provide the points and their basis and context clearly.Work with others. Similar information stemming from multiple sources strengthens believability and credibility.",1
"The best way to counter misinformation in the media is with an aggressive onslaught of facts. During an outbreak, information may be shifting, guidance changing, and questions multiplying, but the process is guided by adherence to reality and logic. Uncertainty is not an excuse for entertaining arbitrary assertions offered in defiance of the need for evidence. They should be identified as such and dismissed.Experts, in addition to relating facts, should also explain the evidence that supports their conclusions and how recommendations are rooted in that evidence. This is a daunting task, as it involves more than information dissemination. It requires attention to what counts as evidence and an understanding of how to evaluate competing claims—some of which are grounded in evidence and some of which clearly are not.",1
"At first glance, patient rooms in the Johns Hopkins Biocontainment Unit look no different than any hospital patient room—until you see the doors. They’re color-coded for health care worker safety. The colors signify required safety procedures to gain entry to a room. Red, for example, might alert a provider to change their personal protective gear.We work so hard to make sure we can safely care for any patient, at any time, and simple safety cues like our doors help us do just that.The design of the 7,900 square-foot unit, including three patient rooms, an onsite lab, shower facilities and clean-in/clean-out anterooms, helps us care for patients safely while protecting our staff and our community. A patient might be feeling scared and disoriented, so making sure they are safe and cared for is the number one priority of our team. ",1
"Early in a coronavirus outbreak, unknowns are a given. But the global health community can’t afford to wait to see if a best- or worst-case scenario unfolds. Some post-haste priorities:Vaccine development: Make this is a top priority. Vaccines can dramatically slow disease spread though they can take at least a year to develop. Plans for large-scale production at different sites worldwide are also needed.Find treatments: Test possible antivirals—such as flu and HIV medications—for treatment options.Expand diagnostic capacity: Manufacture and distribute rapid diagnostic kits so cases can be identified quickly.Boost hospital readiness: Strengthen infection control procedures, train health workers, and keep masks, gowns, and gloves stocked.Communicate: Share facts (and unknowns) clearly with the public, and resist the temptation to withhold bad news.If the virus is ultimately less lethal than feared, or more easily contained, the extra effort will pay off when the next one strikes.",1
"“Beginning preparedness activities when an epidemics hits is too late.  Although the US has a relatively strong health system, we need to be better prepared for an epidemic, particularly by strengthening state and local health departments and connections with health care providers and facilities. But we can’t protect ourselves only within our own borders. Our biggest vulnerability is spread in countries with weak health systems – viruses don’t need visas. The US should double down on support for countries in Africa and Asia so the health workers in these countries can find, stop and prevent epidemics. In the US and globally, there are important and simple things we can do that will prevent illness now and also protect against coronavirus: improve hand hygiene (handwashing), cough hygiene (cover coughs), don’t expose others if we’re feeling ill, and improve health care infection control.”",1
"Travel bans can’t keep all cases of the virus out of a country. As the epidemic expands, cases may originate in any number of countries. We may already have unrecognized cases in the US.Travel bans can actually make us less safe. They can make countries facing restrictions not want to share information about their outbreaks. They can disrupt the distribution of supplies needed to control the epidemic. Similarly, as we saw with the US’s Ebola response in 2014, quarantining returning travelers makes doctors and nurses less likely to volunteer to serve in affected countries.This virus is likely past the point of containment. We need to focus on mitigating its impact by speeding the development of diagnostic tools, vaccines, and drugs to treat infections.",1
"Strong health systems are certainly a crucial foundation for preparedness. All countries, rich or poor, need to have a set of core national preparedness capabilities. For example, they need strong surveillance systems in place that can detect infectious diseases with pandemic potential, robust case detection, and effective contact tracing, identifying and reaching those who may have been in contact with an infected person.But that’s only part of the story. By definition, pandemics cross national boundaries—they are global in nature and they require a global response, not just a national one. A whole set of “transnational” activities, called global public goods, is another critical plank in pandemic preparedness. These require collective funding by all countries. Such goods include developing medical countermeasures like pandemic vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments, stockpiling of medical supplies (including personal protective equipment), and ensuring that there is global “surge capacity” to rapidly scale up production and distribution of vaccines. ",1
"Health care workers are our first line of defense against disease, whether coronavirus or otherwise. In order to safely and effectively do their jobs they need to both have proper training and the right protective equipment. This keeps them safe from infection in “peace time” and during a large outbreak like we have now.
Health care workers are often the first affected by these types of outbreaks and to some extent can act as a canary in the coalmine for how infectious a new disease outbreak is.  In the past, health care workers have died from infections and also amplified initial cases spreading the outbreak quickly.  If we are to protect health workers and limit transmission, we must do more to ensure the right training and the right equipment are available all the time and not just once an outbreak has started.Health workers are making heroic efforts in China, where they have converged on the epicenter. They can only protect us if they are protected.",1
"The tools of public health during suspected infectious outbreaks include limits or restrictions on the movement of individual citizens, ranging from travel bans, to closure of businesses and schools, to isolation of individuals in their homes, to forced quarantine in medical facilities.The goal in implementing public health measures during suspected outbreaks is to balance the freedom of individuals against the restrictions on freedom required to achieve legitimate protections of the public's health, with public and transparent justification of policy decisions.Whatever restrictions are implemented should be the least restrictive to accomplish the stated public health goals. Quarantine is considered a measure of last resort given the severe restrictions it imposes on individual liberty, and when misused or ineffective can severely undermine trust in government. ",1
"Men have higher levels than women of an enzyme central to COVID-19 infection, a new study reveals—which could help explain why men are more vulnerable to the novel coronavirus, Reuters reports.Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2—which helps the invasion of healthy cells—“is thought to play a crucial role in the progression of lung disorders related to COVID-19,” Adriaan Voors, the study’s leader, said in a European Society of Cardiology news release.The research—published today in European Heart Journal—was underway before the pandemic and did not include COVID-19 patients, and thus a direct link cannot be confirmed. However, when the team realized that ACE2 levels were higher in men than women, they wanted to highlight the overlap.
The researchers also found that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers prescribed to heart failure patients did not fuel higher ACE2 levels in plasma—and therefore should not increase the COVID-19 risk. Recent research had flagged the drugs as a potential concern for cardiovascular patients.",1
"Nearly all people exposed to COVID-19 in a New York study developed antibodies to the virus—even those who showed just mild symptoms, according to a New York Times analysis of a preprint study.Based on antibody tests on the first set of donors for a convalescent plasma therapy effort, the research showed that the vast majority of confirmed COVID-19 patients developed antibodies.While the presence of antibodies does not guarantee immunity, and the research is not yet peer-reviewed, it’s a hopeful sign that almost everyone who has been sick will experience some protective benefit, regardless of age, sex, or severity of illness.Questions over the accuracy of antibody tests have been an issue, but the antibody test used in the NY study of 1,343 people, developed by Florian Krammer, an Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai virologist, has a less than 1% chance of producing 0-positives.“Winter” Is Coming... to the Rescue.A llama named Winter packs another cause for hope in the quest for an antibody treatment.Along with the rest of her herd in Belgium, she produces special antibodies—called nanobodies—prized for their staying power and ability to “get into nooks and crannies” in the body. An international team of scientists used tiny antibodies in Winter’s blood to engineer a new antibody that latches on to the spiky proteins on SARS-CoV-2 surface, “neutralizing” its ability to infect cells. Their work, published Tuesday in Cell, is preliminary and would need to be proven in animal studies before it could be tested in humans.",1
"A new study adds to evidence of immunity among those who have already been exposed to the pathogen.A new study offers a glimmer of hope in the grim fight against the coronavirus: Nearly everyone who has had the disease — regardless of age, sex or severity of illness — makes antibodies to the virus.The study, posted online on Tuesday but not yet reviewed by experts, also hints that anyone who has recovered from infection may safely return to work — although it is unclear how long their protection might last.“This is very good news,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York who was not involved with the work.Antibodies are immune molecules produced by the body to fight pathogens. The presence of antibodies in the blood typically confers at least some protection against the invader.Health officials in several countries, including the United States, have hung their hopes on tests that identify coronavirus antibodies to decide who is immune and can go back to work. People who are immune could replace vulnerable individuals, especially in high-transmission settings like hospitals, building what researchers call “shield immunity” in the population.But most antibody tests are fraught with 0 positives — picking up antibody signals where there are none. The new study relied on a test developed by Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, that has a less than 1 percent chance of producing 0-positive results.Several small studies have given reason to hope that people who have had Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, would gain some immunity for some period of time. The new study is the largest by far, with results from 1,343 people in and around New York City.The study also eased a niggling worry that only some people — only those who were severely ill, for example — might make antibodies. In fact, the level of antibodies did not differ by age or sex, and even people who had only mild symptoms produced a healthy amount.Having antibodies is not the same as having immunity to the virus. But in previous research, Dr. Krammer’s team has shown that antibody levels are closely linked with the ability to disarm the virus, the key to immunity.“It really shows that most people do develop antibodies, and that there’s very good correlation between those antibodies and their capability to neutralize virus,” Dr. Rasmussen said.Researchers at Mount Sinai tested people who signed up to be donors of convalescent plasma, antibodies extracted from blood. The project has enrolled more than 15,000 people so far, according to Dr. Ania Wajnberg, who is leading the effort.The new study is an analysis of results of the first set of donors. Over all, only 3 percent of these participants had been seen in the emergency department or had been hospitalized. The remaining subjects had only mild or moderate symptoms.“To my knowledge, this is the largest group of people described with mild disease,” Dr. Wajnberg said.The criteria for inclusion became more stringent as the team learned more about the coronavirus. For example, they initially required the potential donors to be free of symptoms for only three days but later extended that to 14 days.The team tested 624 people who had tested positive for the virus and had recovered. At first, just 511 of them had high antibody levels; 42 had low levels; and 71 had none. When 64 of the subjects with weak or no levels were retested more than a week later, however, all but three had at least some antibodies.
That suggests the timing of testing for antibodies can greatly affect the results, the researchers said. “We weren’t looking exactly at this, but we had enough to say that 14 days is probably a little too early,” Dr. Wajnberg said.There was even a difference between levels at 20 days versus 24 days, she said, suggesting that the optimal time for an antibody test is well after symptoms begin. “What we’re telling people now is at least three weeks after symptom onset,” Dr. Wajnberg said.Because tests to diagnose coronavirus infection were unavailable to most people in New York City in March, the researchers included another 719 people in their study who suspected they had Covid-19 based on symptoms and exposure to the virus, but in whom the illness had not been diagnosed.In this group, the researchers found a different picture altogether. The majority of these people — 62 percent — did not seem to have antibodies.Some of them may have been tested too soon after their illness for antibodies to be detectable. But many probably mistook influenza, another viral infection or even allergies for Covid-19, Dr. Wajnberg said.“I think literally everybody in New York thinks they’ve had it,” she said. “People shouldn’t assume the fever they had in January was Covid and they’re immune.”Other experts were more struck by the percentage of people who turned out to have antibodies, even though the coronavirus had never been diagnosed in them.The number suggests that “in cities like New York, there are a tremendous number of undiagnosed infections,” said Taia Wang, a viral immunologist at Stanford University.An antibody survey conducted by New York State officials found that 20 percent of city residents had been infected.Another finding from the study — that diagnostic PCR tests can be positive up to 28 days after the start of infection — is also important, Dr. Wang said. These tests look for genetic fragments, not antibodies, and suggest an active or waning infection.“As far as known unknowns about SARS-CoV-2, this one really stands out,” she said. “We really need to know, how long does it take the body to clear the virus? How long are people contagious? We don’t know the answer to that.”She and other scientists said it was highly unlikely that a positive test so long after symptoms appeared represents infectious virus. Researchers in South Korea recently announced, for example, that several suspected cases of “reinfection” were a result of PCR tests picking up remnants of dead virus.Genetic material from the measles virus can show up in tests six months after the illness, Dr. Krammer noted. And genetic fragments of Ebola and Zika viruses are known to persist even longer in the body.Still, Dr. Wang said, “Until we do know, it’s prudent for everyone to proceed as if a positive PCR test means contagious virus.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms, but that period may need to be longer.Experts said the next step would be to confirm that the presence of antibodies in the blood means protection from the coronavirus. The body depends on a subset of antibodies, called neutralizing antibodies, to shield it from the coronavirus.“The question now becomes to what extent those are neutralizing antibodies and whether that leads to protection from infection — all of which we should presume are yes,” said Sean Whelan, a virologist at Washington University in St. Louis.In Dr. Krammer’s previous work, to be published in the journal Nature Medicine, his team tested whether the antibodies have neutralizing power. The researchers found that in about a dozen people, including some who had mild symptoms, the level of antibodies in the blood corresponded to the level of neutralizing activity.
So everyone who makes antibodies is likely to have some immunity to the virus, Dr. Krammer said: “I’m fairly confident about this.” Another way to assess immunity would be to show that purified antibodies can prevent coronavirus infection in an animal.But perhaps the most urgent question, especially as research on vaccines ramps up, is how long that immunity might last.Even if the levels of antibodies fall over time to undetectable levels, people may still retain some protection from the coronavirus.Immune cells called T cells are valuable soldiers in fighting pathogens, and at least one study has shown that the coronavirus provokes a strong response from these cells. So-called memory cells, or B cells, may also kick into gear when they encounter the coronavirus, churning out more antibodies.Ultimately, however, the answer to how long immunity lasts will come only with patience.“Unless someone has come up with some way to speed that process up,” Dr. Rasmussen said, “the only way to tell that is by following these patients over time.”",1
"COVID-19 patients given remdesivir recovered faster than those taking a placebo, according to preliminary results from a clinical trial released by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases yesterday.The experimental drug speeded recovery by 4 days for patients hospitalized with advanced COVID-19—reducing it from 15 days to 11 days, STAT reports.NIAID director Anthony Fauci hailed the results as a “very important proof of concept,” but cautioned it’s not a “knockout.” The difference in the mortality rate—8% for the remdesivir group vs. 11.6% for the placebo group—is not considered statistically significant. NIAID said more comprehensive data will be released soon.
It is also likely that the treatment will work best when given early—and therefore, better diagnostic testing will be key to identifying potential beneficiaries as soon as possible. “What will be important is that we find (vulnerable) people on the outpatient side,” who are positive, and bring them into the hospital if they take a turn for the worse, says, Nahid Bhadelia, medical director of Boston Medical Center's Special Pathogens Unit.Some scientists also raised concerns about the preliminary release in the White House, ahead of scientific peer review, according to The New York Times. Fauci cited concerns about leaks and the ethical need to switch people on the placebo to the drug for the early release, Reuters reports. The FDA appears poised to announce emergency-use authorization for the drug.",1
"Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a group of US scientists made a major discovery. They figured out the molecular structure of the “spike protein” that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to invade human cells.The researchers were eager to share the news that could help develop potential vaccines and drugs. Although the usual scientific publication process from submission to publication is measured in months, the spike paper blazed through it in 9 days and was published online in Science on February 19—“which is incredible,” says Sudip Parikh, PhD, CEO of the AAAS and executive publisher of the Science family of journals. He remembers telling reviewers to drop everything in order to expedite the process. As COVID-19 continues to burn through the populations worldwide, biological, epidemiological and other insights are informing public health strategies and policies in real time. New research can mean lives saved.For example, a recent Chinese study in Nature that supported the use of face masks by the general public appears to have influenced policy in the US. And Parikh notes that modeling studies conducted at Harvard, Columbia, Northeastern University, and Imperial College of London profoundly influenced the pandemic response by prompting the adoption of social distancing measures across the U.S. and Europe. “If my mom knows about flattening the curve, we’ve struck something,” he says.In addition to those studies, scientists have produced an astounding 17,000+ COVID-19 research articles listed in a CDC database. But does speed have a price in accuracy? Not in the case of the spike paper, Parikh says. The reviewers who examined the research held it to their usual rigorous standards but accelerated the pace because of the study’s importance. Parikh admits that kind of speed isn’t always possible. Scientific journals don’t have enough bandwidth to publish everything they see that quickly while maintaining their traditional standards. But they can do so in a targeted way to get the most important work out the door without delay, he says.The challenge, he says, lies in curating the flood of material being produced and publishing the most significant work as quickly as possible. Overall, Parikh says he doesn’t see a decline in the quality of the research being submitted to peer-reviewed outlets—though studies appearing on preprint servers without peer review may be suspect. (Peer review, which traces its roots back 3 centuries, involves the close study of a paper’s merits and flaws by experts in the field. Preprint articles are draft articles that haven’t yet been peer reviewed.) “There’s probably a lot of stuff out there that will need to be corrected,” says Parikh, who is nonetheless amazed by how quickly labs around the world have pivoted to produce high-quality coronavirus research. Sander Greenland, DrPH, a professor emeritus of Epidemiology and Statistics at UCLA, thinks the question of whether research conducted under crisis conditions can be trusted may be misplaced: Studies have limitations even under the best of circumstances, and reliability is always a matter of degree.“Every study is flawed. The question is, what can you get out of it, and for what purpose?” he says. At the moment, Greenland says, the lack of certain kinds of data may represent the principal challenge to an effective pandemic response. Researchers need to know the 0 positive and negative rates of the tests used to identify infected individuals, for example, in order to understand how prevalent COVID-19 really is—and what the true fatality rate might be. But test manufacturers are not necessarily supplying that data.Similarly, doctors need to know exactly how many patients diagnosed with COVID-19 are dying due to underlying conditions or complications from co-infections in order to understand how virulent the virus really is and who most needs protection from it. But that data is not being systematically collected and reported.
Without that information, Greenland says, scientists and policymakers are left to make educated guesses about everything from infection rates to control measures. “It’s like trying to predict where the stock market is going to be in 3 months,” he says. Better data collection and reporting would help resolve these issues, Greenland notes. Then again, researchers are used to dealing with incomplete data during epidemics, pandemics, and outbreaks.“There is always a paucity of data under these conditions,” says Stephen Morse, PhD, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. Testing tends to be highly selective, for example, and random samples are hard to come by. But math can help researchers deal with gaps in their data. For instance, Morse points out that epidemiologists have developed a variety of statistical methods for estimating the values of missing data—a process known as imputation. And valuable work can still be done using traditional epidemiological methods such as contact tracing: In Singapore, Morse notes, contract tracers used a new antibody test to identify previously unidentified chains of transmission—an important step in containing the virus. Moving forward, Morse hopes the current crisis will motivate researchers to finally put in place “things we have thought and talked about but never implemented,” such as better early surveillance and rapid diagnostic tests to help contain future outbreaks.For his part, Parikh believes that some of what scientists have already learned about operating during the pandemic—from streamlining the review process to adopting virtual clinical trials that allow researchers to collect participant data remotely without having people appear at clinic sites—will provide lasting benefits long after the crisis is over. “I think we’re going to think of this as BC and AC,” he says. “Before coronavirus and after coronavirus.”",1
"For many, a COVID-19 vaccine can’t come soon enough, but vaccine opponents are already undermining “confidence in what could be humanity’s best chance to defeat the virus,” the AP reports.They’re spreading misinformation:Vaccine trials will be rushed.Anthony Fauci is in cahoots with vaccine makers seeking to profit off the tragedy, Bill Gates wants to use a vaccine to inject people with microchips or curb the population.They’ve also endorsed questionable treatments, stirred up fears about mandatory vaccinations, and aligned themselves with people resisting stay-at-home orders.“Myths and misinformation about vaccines are adding fuel to the fire,” said Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in remarks Monday to mark World Immunization Week. He called out vaccine skeptics for spreading misinformation at a time when many children are already missing out on routine vaccines because of the pandemic.“It seems unimaginable that anyone would reject a coronavirus vaccine,” writes Alex Hartlage in an exclusive commentary for Global Health NOW. Yet, he notes, the last 2 decades, vaccine hesitancy has risen so substantially that “old enemies once thought conquered are returning.”Cultural amnesia is largely to blame, Hartlage writes. “Vaccines largely erased fear of these diseases from our collective American consciousness; along with it, our sense of appreciation ... Now, however, that fear has been rekindled.”He sees promising signs, though, that humans—once again ""forced to grapple with our own human frailty,” will unite for the common good in a new era of social responsibility.

"COVID-19 poses a risk not only to the health of older adults who contract the disease but also to those without the health care resources and social structures that contribute to overall wellness. Before becoming a professor, Sarah Szanton made house calls to older adults as a nurse practitioner. On her visits, she saw how an older person's home environment can contribute to health outcomes. Now, as the Endowed Professor for Health Equity and Social Justice at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing and the director of the Center for Innovative Care in Aging, Szanton works to identify solutions to narrow racial and socioeconomic disparities for older people.Szanton joined one of her PhD student mentees, Sarah LaFave, to discuss the challenges that COVID-19 poses for older adults. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting older people differently than younger generations?Older adults are more likely to have dire outcomes from the virus. It can also be a challenge to prevent older people from being exposed to the virus because they may not be be fully independent. For example, a mother might rely on her adult daughter to come and help her with groceries or take a shower. As another example, some older people depend on help from a family member or friend with sorting mail and sending in checks to pay bills. At this point, people may not have had someone come into the home to help with those kinds of things for many weeks. What happens if one of those unpaid bills is for an essential resource or accrues a lot of interest during this time?We also have to think about all of the ways that the pandemic affects older people's lives beyond morbidity and mortality from the virus itself. I am concerned about people experiencing social isolation as a result of not being able to have visitors and not being able to go out and do things with other people. The effects are compounded for any older person who doesn't have access to technology platforms like Skype and FaceTime or who has limited access to phone calls. Many lower-income older people have pay-per-minute phone plans, for example, and may have to choose between using their limited minutes for a phone visit with a doctor or a conversation with a grandchild. So we can't assume that a switch to virtual socialization or virtual access to resources is going to work for all older people.Also, I think there's a fair amount of ageism—of people thinking right now, even if they aren't saying it out loud, ""Well, older people are going to die anyway."" But who are we to say that an 80-year-old wouldn't have otherwise lived to be 100 and done a lot of wonderful things in those 20 years? We would never think that the first 20 years of someone's life don't matter; we should recognize that the last 20 years are just as valuable.Has the pandemic exacerbated health disparities for older adults?Every experience in life is influenced by a person's access to resources and, in the United States, a person's race, socioeconomic status, and other characteristics have profound impacts on access to resources. It can be easy to jump to saying, ""Oh, well, that person was older and had diabetes, so of course they had a worse outcome from COVID."" But you have to take a step back and ask what contributed to the person having diabetes in the first place. Because race is not biological, we know that it's not race itself that causes disparities in co-morbidities and in COVID outcomes—it's the relationship between race and resources. For example, my colleague Laura Samuel has found that the counties that have a high proportion of people who have to spend more than a third of their income on housing have higher COVID mortality rates. If we had a society that was structured so that everyone had the same chance at health, we would not see the disparities we are seeing.A lot of the potential solutions to health disparities among older adults don't exist in the health care system itself—they occur further upstream. Things like widening access to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, addressing food deserts, and supporting returning citizens in the workforce all relate directly to health, but we don't always think that way.What challenges has COVID-19 raised for family caregivers of older adults?
First, if family caregivers have jobs that require them to be in regular contact with others, such as bus drivers or nurses, they may have to decide between not providing essential help to an older loved one and risking passing the virus to that person.Second, direct care workers continue to come in and out of hospitals, nursing homes, and senior living buildings and are being screened upon entrance, but very few family caregivers are allowed into these same facilities right now. In some cases, family caregivers are not being recognized as essential parts of the health care team, and I think they should be. Hospitals and nursing homes have had to place restrictions on visitors for safety reasons, but I think some of those policies may be too limiting. For example, delirium is a very common and very costly issue for older adults who are admitted to hospitals. There is a better chance of preventing and managing delirium if a family member can help attend to the day-night sleep cycle, keep the person oriented, hydrated, and so on. True delirium uses so many health care resources that it can benefit all of us if an older person has a familiar caregiver with them during an inpatient stay. Of course, a major limitation is that there isn't enough personal protective equipment right now, so you have to weigh the risks and benefits of tapping into a finite supply of protective equipment.
What can people do right now to support older adults in their communities during this crisis?There are many volunteer opportunities. For example, Baltimore Neighbors Network is a coalition of community partners that trains and supports volunteers to provide companionship and resource navigation assistance to older adults in Baltimore, which includes remote options such as phone calls. If people can't volunteer for a program like that right now, maybe they can give blood, or maybe they can take the money they would usually spend eating out each month and instead contribute financially to a food pantry. People can also support their older family members or friends by asking the person what would be most helpful to them—maybe it's dropping off a meal on a front porch, maybe it's mailing a letter. It's really important to remember, even during a crisis, to make time for our elders.",1
"As countries around the world ease the lockdowns that have been crippling their economies, the race is on to develop smartphone apps to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus when people are no longer confined to their homes.Scientists say contact tracing is key to prevent a resurgence of the virus, by tracking down infected people and finding everyone who has been near them, so they can get tested or quarantined.On Tuesday, Britain started testing its own COVID-19 tracing app on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England. It joins Australia, Israel, Singapore and other nations in rolling out such tools.But the tech race has raised privacy and accuracy concerns among rights groups and technology experts.And the question of whether the apps can deliver on their promise is a matter of debate, with researchers warning that mobile phones are no silver bullet against COVID-19.“A mobile app alone is not enough,” said Thomas Hardjono, chief technology officer for the Connection Science programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which has built its own app.Further research to better understand the virus and consistent testing efforts would be needed to complement any contact tracing app, he said. “It needs to be part of a bigger effort.”Worldwide, about 3.6 million people have been infected by the respiratory disease and more than 250,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally.BEYOND TRADITIONAL TRACING. Contact tracing has been used for decades to control the spread of infectious diseases and is normally carried out by public health investigators who interview patients to find out who they have met and where they have been in the previous days.But with almost half of novel coronavirus transmissions occurring before symptoms appear, traditional methods are too slow to keep up, researchers say.
A report published in April by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Maryland said the United States needed 100,000 more contact tracers to effectively tackle the pandemic.Given the virus’ rapid spread, even a single day’s delay in contact tracing could be the difference between getting the virus under control and suffering a resurgence, according to researchers from the University of Oxford in Britain.Here is where health experts say apps can help.Smartphones keep track of their location via cell-tower signals, Wi-Fi signals and the satellite-based global positioning system, known as GPS.Through Bluetooth technology, which allows devices to connect to others nearby, phones can also log other phones that have come within a few metres of them.
Using that data, contact tracing apps can instantly inform users if they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, and advise them to call a doctor, get tested or self-isolate.DIGITAL HANDSHAKES.But the prospect of widespread data collection worries some citizens and civil rights groups like European Digital Rights.The use of GPS and other geolocation data could provide authorities with a detailed map of a user’s every movement, leaving the door open to abuse, said Diego Naranjo, head of policy at the digital civil rights group.“That gives (authorities) a very accurate description of your reality and who you are ... it should be avoided at all costs,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.If the data were to become public, people at risk of infection could face discrimination and the places they visited become ostracized, privacy activists say.
Apps that work only through Bluetooth could offer more privacy protections because they amass less information, collecting only data about who people meet but not where they are, said Naranjo.Yet, issues remain around who can view a phone’s list of the devices it has connected with, known as “handshakes”.Some states favour storing all the data on a central server, while others prefer a system in which Bluetooth logs would be kept on individual devices.Centralised systems are easier to design and manage and would allow health authorities access to more information, but privacy advocates say they could also expose millions of people’s personal data to hacks and leaks.“Decentralised is the best option,” said Naranjo. “It gives more power to the individual and diminishes the risk.”NO ALTERNATIVE.Contact tracing apps are also not foolproof, tech and biology experts have warned.GPS or cell tower location data can wrongly record everyone on a busy city block as contacts.Similarly, Bluetooth can log phones that are near each other but separated by walls, although developers have been working on ways to better define “contacts” based on the length and strength of the handshakes between devices.Apps also do not take into account whether users who have been in contact with others were wearing protective equipment at the time, according to researchers from the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.This raises the possibility of an app flagging someone as being in danger of infection even if, in reality, the risk is minimal, the researchers say.“There is a real risk that these mobile-based apps can turn unaffected individuals into social pariahs, restricted from accessing public and private spaces or participating in social and economic activities,” they wrote in an article last month.Another challenge is take up, with some epidemiologists saying at least 40% of a country’s population needs to activate digital contact tracing for the system to be effective.In Singapore, only about one in five people have downloaded a government-backed Bluetooth-based contact tracing app since it launched in March.
About 12% of Australians have so far installed a similar app that was launched last week.And a poll released in April by the Washington Post and the University of Maryland found more than half of all Americans either do not own smartphones or would not use the contact tracing app being developed by tech giants Google and Apple.Yet, even with all their limitations, apps could still prove useful - if only because there is no alternative, said Hardjono of MIT.“Right now, this is all we have,” he said.",1
"We have listened with concern to voices erroneously suggesting that herd immunity may “soon slow the spread” of COVID-19. For example, Rush Limbaugh recently claimed that “herd immunity has occurred in California.” As infectious disease epidemiologists, we wish to state clearly that herd immunity against COVID-19 will not be achieved at a population level in 2020, barring a public health catastrophe.Although more than 2.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, studies suggest that (as of early April 2020) no more than 2-4%3–5 of any country’s population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19). Even in hotspots like New York City that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, initial studies suggest that perhaps 15-21%, of people have been exposed so far. In getting to that level of exposure, more than 17,500 of the 8.4 million people in New York City (about 1 in every 500 New Yorkers) have died, with the overall death rate in the city suggesting deaths may be undercounted and mortality may be even higher.Some have entertained the idea of “controlled voluntary infection,” akin to the “chickenpox parties” of the 1980s. However, COVID-19 is 100 times more lethal than the chickenpox. For example, on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the mortality rate among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 was 1%. Someone who goes to a “coronavirus party” to get infected would not only be substantially increasing their own chance of dying in the next month, they would also be putting their families and friends at risk. COVID-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States, killing almost 2,000 Americans every day. Chickenpox never killed more than 150 Americans in a year.To reach herd immunity for COVID-19, likely 70% or more of the population would need to be immune. Without a vaccine, over 200 million Americans would have to get infected before we reach this threshold. Put another way, even if the current pace of the COVID-19 pandemic continues in the United States – with over 25,000 confirmed cases a day – it will be well into 2021 before we reach herd immunity. If current daily death rates continue, over half a million Americans would be dead from COVID-19 by that time.As we discuss when and how to phase in re-opening,10 it is important to understand how vulnerable we remain. Increased testing will help us better understand the scope of infection, but it is clear this pandemic is still only beginning to unfold.",1
"RUSH: We just reran the models projecting audience levels at the Rush Limbaugh program and the EIB Network, and we gained another two million people since the program started. We’re up to 42 million people tuning into the program in any 15-minute period based on latest model projections. (interruption) What’s that?
“Who’s doing the models?” Well, we are at the EIB Network. We’re running the models ourselves. We have the models. The models run constantly just the model on my opinion audit, the Sullivan Group in California. But those models are being run. We are plugging in various data in order to get the latest actual news.
So it’s 42 million, according to our model projections. You can’t argue with that. (interruption) What do you mean? (interruption) What are you arguing with me about? You can’t argue with model projections! (interruption) Yeah, we added two million people. Our model projection was able to calculate that, yes.Okay. A couple of very, very interesting stories. I went back to California, searched California news in November and December of last year. I found two fascinating stories. One is at a publication called Patch.com and the other one is ChicagoCityWire.com. These stories were all over California news throughout last fall. Here is the headline for the Patch.com story. This story was published on January 10th.“Flu Outbreak Plagues California with 16 New Deaths — The flu season ramped up over the holidays and continues to cause sicken [sic] thousands up and down the state. Sixteen more Californians’ deaths from the flu were confirmed in the first week of the New Year as influenza grips the nation. The spike in flu outbreaks that ended the decade continued to ramp up in 2020 in California and around the nation.“So far this flu season, California health officials have identified 19 outbreaks since the start of the flu season on September 29. Through January 4, 70 people have died from the flu statewide, according to state officials. ‘Nationally, influenza activity is increasing. All regions of the country are experiencing elevated levels of influenza-like illness. It is too soon to say how severe this [flu] season might be,’ a spokesman for the California Department of Public Health told Patch.“‘Influenza activity began increasing in early November in California, which was a few weeks earlier than other recent seasons. Influenza activity in California continues to increase. Since [the flu] is unpredictable, we do not know how long the high level of activity will last and what the overall severity level of the season might ultimately be.'”They were dealing with coronavirus and didn’t know it, and they were calling it the flu from as far back as last November. This has to be what this was. It was an unidentified strain of the flu. It came out of nowhere. It was surprising health officials in the state. People were dying from it and people were not dying from it, which happens every flu season.See, folks, I think this is one of the reasons why the models are breaking down. The models are breaking down — and again on the models, they’re trying to cover for themselves by saying, “Well, the numbers are coming down because we’re plugging in social distancing.” Social distancing has been plugged into the models ever since that 2.2 million dead projection was made.It is not something new that they’re doing. They are misrepresenting it. They are so focused on you believing that social distancing is why the projections are lower that they’re now telling things that aren’t true. Social distancing has been plugged into their models. So I think one of the reasons that the models are breaking down is that the virus was likely here, certainly in California, as early as November.The Chinese… I think they’ve been lying about this and about the first case from the beginning. In this story at Patch.com, it says, “In California, the majority of flu deaths have occured [sic] in patients 65-years-old or older.” You know me. I believe herd immunity has occurred in California. I think that’s what explains the relatively low number of cases and deaths compared to, say, New York.They want to still maintain it’s social distancing, even though California only had a two- to three-day head start. A two- to three-day head start’s not gonna explain the massive differences. So why is this good news? It’s good news because it shows that an immunity to this can be developed. There was no stand-down order. There was no stay-at-home order when this flu — what they thought was a flu — outbreak hit.People just lived through it. I have since talked to people in California who now think they had it. They had the flu in November, and they had the flu in December. That’s all they thought it was. There was no such thing as coronavirus. I mean, coronavirus hit in December as something crazy, weird out of China, but it didn’t become part of the daily news lexicon until sometime in January — late January when the president announced a ban on all travel from China.Here is another story. This is from Chicago: “A phlebotomist working at Roseland Community Hospital said Thursday that 30% to 50% of patients tested for the coronavirus have antibodies while only around 10% to 20% of those tested have the active virus. — Roseland Hospital Phlebotomist: 30% of Those Tested Have Coronavirus Antibody.” How can that be? It means they have developed an immunity to it.They were infected. Some of them did not suffer. Some of them did not develop symptoms, but they had the disease, developed antibodies. “A phlebotomist working at Roseland Community Hospital said Thursday that 30% to 50% of patients tested for the coronavirus have antibodies while only around 10% to 20% of those tested have the active virus.“Sumaya Owaynat, a phlebotomy technician, said she tests between 400 and 600 patients on an average day in the parking lot at Roseland Community Hospital. Drive-thru testing is from 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m. each day. However, the hospital has a limited number of tests they can give per day. Owaynat said the number of patients coming through the testing center who appear to have already had coronavirus and gotten over it is far greater than those who currently have the disease.”Hello, herd immunity.“‘A lot of people have high antibodies, which means they had the coronavirus but they don’t have it anymore and their bodies built the antibodies,’ Owaynat told Chicago City Wire. Antibodies in the bloodstream reveal that a person has already had the coronavirus and may be immune to contracting the virus again. If accurate, this means the spread of the virus may have been underway in the Roseland community — and the state and country as a whole — prior to the issuance of stay at home orders…”It has to be the case, folks. There can be no other explanation for this. Now, it may sound like a weird story from a Chicago hospital drive-thru test. Could 30% of parts of the worst virus areas that are locked down in Chicago already have immunity? And it is fascinating that this is not discussed. In fact, when herd immunity comes up, current health officials pooh-pooh it.They say, “No, no, no, no! We don’t want to go there. We don’t want to go there. That means a lot of people have to get infected.” Well, if herd immunity explains California… Look at the numbers. The numbers are way low compared to the worst parts of the country. You know, Trump had this vision of being able to reopen a country by this Sunday, by Easter.I think he could. I think in parts of this country, we could reopen. We couldn’t reopen in New York. We couldn’t reopen in New Jersey or Connecticut. But there are parts of the country we could reopen without question. Not going to, but, I mean, we could. We are waiting for permission to reopen the country from experts who have been wrong from the get-go. President Trump is working on plans to reopen the country.The Democrats and the media are working on plans to keep it closed. You talk about a divide. You talk about a lack of unity. (Snort!) This is the definition of it. Trump’s job is to explain both the safety and the necessity of going back to work. It appears that the Democrats and the media’s job is to make Trump appear to be a bloodthirsty killer for wanting Americans to die.Experts have scared the holy hell out of millions of Americans to the point they don’t feel safe leaving their homes now — and that’s because these said experts relied on computer models that were so bad, the creators have had to revise them time and time and time again.",0
"No matter where you go online these days, there’s bound to be discussion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Some folks are even making outrageous claims that the new coronavirus causing the pandemic was engineered in a lab and deliberately released to make people sick. A new study debunks such claims by providing scientific evidence that this novel coronavirus arose naturally.The reassuring findings are the result of genomic analyses conducted by an international research team, partly supported by NIH. In their study in the journal Nature Medicine, Kristian Andersen, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA; Robert Garry, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans; and their colleagues used sophisticated bioinformatic tools to compare publicly available genomic data from several coronaviruses, including the new one that causes COVID-19.The researchers began by homing in on the parts of the coronavirus genomes that encode the spike proteins that give this family of viruses their distinctive crown-like appearance. (By the way, “corona” is Latin for “crown.”) All coronaviruses rely on spike proteins to infect other cells. But, over time, each coronavirus has fashioned these proteins a little differently, and the evolutionary clues about these modifications are spelled out in their genomes.The genomic data of the new coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 show that its spike protein contains some unique adaptations. One of these adaptations provides special ability of this coronavirus to bind to a specific protein on human cells called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). A related coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans also seeks out ACE2.Existing computer models predicted that the new coronavirus would not bind to ACE2 as well as the SARS virus. However, to their surprise, the researchers found that the spike protein of the new coronavirus actually bound far better than computer predictions, likely because of natural selection on ACE2 that enabled the virus to take advantage of a previously unidentified alternate binding site. Researchers said this provides strong evidence that that new virus was not the product of purposeful manipulation in a lab. In fact, any bioengineer trying to design a coronavirus that threatened human health probably would never have chosen this particular conformation for a spike protein.The researchers went on to analyze genomic data related to the overall molecular structure, or backbone, of the new coronavirus. Their analysis showed that the backbone of the new coronavirus’s genome most closely resembles that of a bat coronavirus discovered after the COVID-19 pandemic began. However, the region that binds ACE2 resembles a novel virus found in pangolins, a strange-looking animal sometimes called a scaly anteater. This provides additional evidence that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 almost certainly originated in nature. If the new coronavirus had been manufactured in a lab, scientists most likely would have used the backbones of coronaviruses already known to cause serious diseases in humans.So, what is the natural origin of the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic? The researchers don’t yet have a precise answer. But they do offer two possible scenarios.In the first scenario, as the new coronavirus evolved in its natural hosts, possibly bats or pangolins, its spike proteins mutated to bind to molecules similar in structure to the human ACE2 protein, thereby enabling it to infect human cells. This scenario seems to fit other recent outbreaks of coronavirus-caused disease in humans, such as SARS, which arose from cat-like civets; and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which arose from camels.The second scenario is that the new coronavirus crossed from animals into humans before it became capable of causing human disease. Then, as a result of gradual evolutionary changes over years or perhaps decades, the virus eventually gained the ability to spread from human-to-human and cause serious, often life-threatening disease.Either way, this study leaves little room to refute a natural origin for COVID-19. And that’s a good thing because it helps us keep focused on what really matters: observing good hygiene, practicing social distancing, and supporting the efforts of all the dedicated health-care professionals and researchers who are working so hard to address this major public health challenge.Finally, next time you come across something about COVID-19 online that disturbs or puzzles you, I suggest going to FEMA’s new Coronavirus Rumor Control web site. It may not have all the answers to your questions, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction in helping to distinguish rumors from facts.",1
"Even in less challenging times, many of us try to avoid close contact with someone who is sneezing, coughing, or running a fever to avoid getting sick ourselves. Our attention to such issues has now been dramatically heightened by the emergence of a novel coronavirus causing a pandemic of an illness known as COVID-19.
Many have wondered if we couldn’t simply protect ourselves by avoiding people with symptoms of respiratory illness. Unfortunately, the answer is no. A new study shows that simply avoiding symptomatic people will not go far enough to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. That’s because researchers have discovered that many individuals can carry the novel coronavirus without showing any of the typical symptoms of COVID-19: fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. But these asymptomatic or only mildly ill individuals can still shed virus and infect others.This conclusion adds further weight to the recent guidance from U.S. public health experts: what we need most right now to slow the stealthy spread of this new coronavirus is a full implementation of social distancing. What exactly does social distancing mean? Well, for starters, it is recommended that people stay at home as much as possible, going out only for critical needs like groceries and medicines, or to exercise and enjoy the outdoors in wide open spaces. Other recommendations include avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people, no handshakes, regular handwashing, and, when encountering someone outside of your immediate household, trying to remain at least 6 feet apart.These may sound like extreme measures. But the new study by NIH-funded researchers, published in the journal Science, documents why social distancing may be our best hope to slow the spread of COVID-19 [1]. Here are a few highlights of the paper, which looks back to January 2020 and mathematically models the spread of the coronavirus within China:For every confirmed case of COVID-19, there are likely another five to 10 people with undetected infections.Although they are thought to be only about half as infectious as individuals with confirmed COVID-19, individuals with undetected infections were so prevalent in China that they apparently were the infection source for 86 percent of confirmed cases.After China established travel restrictions and social distancing, the spread of COVID-19 slowed considerably.The findings come from a small international research team that included NIH grantee Jeffrey Shaman, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York. The team developed a computer model that enabled researchers to simulate the time and place of infections in a grid of 375 Chinese cities. The researchers did so by combining existing data on the spread of COVID-19 in China with mobility information collected by a location-based service during the country’s popular 40-day Spring Festival, when travel is widespread.As these new findings clearly demonstrate, each of us must take social distancing seriously in our daily lives. Social distancing helped blunt the pandemic in China, and it will work in other nations, including the United States. While many Americans will likely spend weeks working and studying from home and practicing other social distancing measures, the stakes remain high. If this pandemic isn’t contained, this novel coronavirus could well circulate around the globe for years to come, at great peril to us and our loved ones.As we commit ourselves to spending more time at home, progress continues to be made in using the power of biomedical research to combat this novel coronavirus. A notable step this week was the launch of an early-stage human clinical trial of an investigational vaccine, called mRNA-1273, to protect against COVID-19 [2]. The vaccine candidate was developed by researchers at NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., Cambridge, MA.This Phase 1 NIAID-supported trial will look at the safety of the vaccine—which cannot cause infection because it is made of RNA, not the whole coronavirus—in 45 healthy adults. The first volunteer was injected this past Monday at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle. If all goes well and larger follow-up clinical studies establish the vaccine’s safety and efficacy, it will then be necessary to scale up production to make millions of doses. While initiating this trial in record time is reason for hope, it is important to be realistic about all of the steps that still remain. If the vaccine candidate proves safe and effective, it will likely take at least 12–18 months before it would be widely available.In the meantime, social distancing remains one of the best weapons we have to slow the silent spread of this virus and flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic. This will give our health-care professionals, hospitals, and other institutions more valuable time to prepare, protect themselves, and aid the many people whose lives may be on the line from this coronavirus.Importantly, saving lives from COVID-19 requires all of us—young, old and in-between—to take part. Healthy young people, whose risk of dying from coronavirus is not zero but quite low, might argue that they shouldn’t be constrained by social distancing. However, the research highlighted here demonstrates that such individuals are often the unwitting vector for a dangerous virus that can do great harm—and even take the lives of older and more vulnerable people. Think about your grandparents. Then skip the big gathering. We are all in this together",1
"There’s been a lot of excitement about the potential of antibody-based blood tests, also known as serology tests, to help contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There’s also an awareness that more research is needed to determine when—or even if—people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, produce antibodies that may protect them from re-infection.A recent study in Nature Medicine brings much-needed clarity, along with renewed enthusiasm, to efforts to develop and implement widescale antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 [1]. Antibodies are blood proteins produced by the immune system to fight foreign invaders like viruses, and may help to ward off future attacks by those same invaders.In their study of blood drawn from 285 people hospitalized with severe COVID-19, researchers in China, led by Ai-Long Huang, Chongqing Medical University, found that all had developed SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies within two to three weeks of their first symptoms. Although more follow-up work is needed to determine just how protective these antibodies are and for how long, these findings suggest that the immune systems of people who survive COVID-19 have been be primed to recognize SARS-CoV-2 and possibly thwart a second infection.Specifically, the researchers determined that nearly all of the 285 patients studied produced a type of antibody called IgM, which is the first antibody that the body makes when fighting an infection. Though only about 40 percent produced IgM in the first week after onset of COVID-19, that number increased steadily to almost 95 percent two weeks later. All of these patients also produced a type of antibody called IgG. While IgG often appears a little later after acute infection, it has the potential to confer sustained immunity.To confirm their results, the researchers turned to another group of 69 people diagnosed with COVID-19. The researchers collected blood samples from each person upon admission to the hospital and every three days thereafter until discharge. The team found that, with the exception of one woman and her daughter, the patients produced specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 within 20 days of their first symptoms of COVID-19.Meanwhile, innovative efforts are being made on the federal level to advance COVID-19 testing. The NIH just launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) Initiative to support a variety of research activities aimed at improving detection of the virus. As I recently highlighted on this blog, one key component of RADx is a “shark tank”-like competition to encourage science and engineering’s most inventive minds to develop rapid, easy-to-use technologies to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.On the serology testing side, the NIH’s National Cancer Institute has been checking out kits that are designed to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and have found mixed results. In response, the Food and Drug Administration just issued its updated policy on antibody tests for COVID-19. This guidance sets forth precise standards for laboratories and commercial manufacturers that will help to speed the availability of high-quality antibody tests, which in turn will expand the capacity for rapid and widespread testing in the United States.Finally, it’s important to keep in mind that there are two different types of SARS-CoV-2 tests. Those that test for the presence of viral nucleic acid or protein are used to identify people who are acutely infected and should be immediately quarantined. Tests for IgM and/or IgG antibodies to the virus, if well-validated, indicate a person has previously been infected with COVID-19 and is now potentially immune. Two very different types of tests—two very different meanings.
There’s still a way to go with both virus and antibody testing for COVID-19. But as this study and others begin to piece together the complex puzzle of antibody-mediated immunity, it will be possible to learn more about the human body’s response to SARS-CoV-2 and home in on our goal of achieving safe, effective, and sustained protection against this devastating disease.",1
"The emergence and rapid increase in cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, pose complex challenges to the global public health, research and medical communities, write federal scientists from NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Their commentary appears in The New England Journal of Medicine.NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., NIAID Deputy Director for Clinical Research and Special Projects H. Clifford Lane, M.D., and CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, M.D., shared their observations in the context of a recently published report(link is external) on the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The report provided detailed clinical and epidemiological information about the first 425 cases to arise in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.In response to the outbreak, the United States and other countries instituted temporary travel restrictions, which may have slowed the spread of COVID-19 somewhat, the authors note. However, given the apparent efficiency of virus transmission, everyone should be prepared for COVID-19 to gain a foothold throughout the world, including in the United States, they add. If the disease begins to spread in U.S. communities, containment may no longer be a realistic goal and response efforts likely will need to transition to various mitigation strategies, which could include isolating ill people at home, closing schools and encouraging telework, the officials write.Drs. Fauci, Lane and Redfield point to the many research efforts now underway to address COVID-19. These include numerous vaccine candidates proceeding toward early-stage clinical trials as well as clinical trials already underway to test candidate therapeutics, including an NIAID-sponsored trial of the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir that began enrolling participants on February 21, 2020. “The COVID-19 outbreak is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenge of emerging and re-emerging infectious pathogens and the need for constant surveillance, prompt diagnosis and robust research to understand the basic biology of new organisms and our susceptibilities to them, as well as to develop effective countermeasures,” the authors conclude.",1
"Full-scale efforts are underway to develop a vaccine free us from COVID-19’s deadly grip. But even if they succeed (and that’s no guarantee), the question regrettably must be asked: Will people take it?Given the severity of the current crisis, taking countless lives and sending our socioeconomic systems to the brink of collapse, it seems unimaginable that anyone would reject a Coronavirus vaccine. Yet, over the last 2 decades, vaccine hesitancy has risen so substantially that the WHO now considers it a major threat to global health.Because some communities are refusing vaccines, old enemies once thought conquered are returning. Last year, for instance, the US saw its highest number of measles cases since 1992, nearly costing the nation its elimination status.Reasons for vaccine hesitancy vary, but most stem from a case of cultural amnesia. Vaccines work because they shield our bodies from disease. But in doing so, they also shield our minds. Most of us have never experienced anything close to the fear and uncertainty created by COVID-19. But similar crises have occurred throughout history. In 1918, an influenza pandemic erupted across the globe, killing 50 million people in its wake and hospitalizing countless more. Polio terrorized the US for most of the first half of the 20th century, striking abruptly and paralyzing generations of children. Smallpox, a deadly and disfiguring disease dating back to the 3rd century BCE, was finally eradicated in 1980 through vaccination.Vaccines largely erased fear of these diseases from our collective American consciousness; along with it, our sense of appreciation. Now, however, that fear has been rekindled. We have once again been forced to grapple with our own human frailty in the face of a viral pandemic for which science does not yet have a solution. But out of this uncertainty, we have united in a manner that holds future promise. In a country that prides itself on its individualism, it is inspiring to see so many readily make sacrifices to protect what we hold dearest: each other.If a COVID-19 vaccine is developed, it is easy to envision our collective spirit translating into a renewed immunization movement— driven not by government coercion, but rather by voluntary action predicated on a revived understanding of the threat these diseases pose—both to ourselves and to humanity. Hopefully, vaccination will be viewed for what it is; an act of civil service taken to protect not only one’s self but also those most vulnerable within our communities, including those who serve on the frontlines. Poorly accepted vaccines such as influenza—a disease responsible for >60,000 deaths in the US last season—might be viewed as the only sensible choice in a new era of social responsibility.Nevertheless, if we do enter a renewed age of vaccine appreciation, how long will it last? As years pass, will we inevitably fall into the same pattern of apathy until the next pandemic strikes? History tends to repeat itself and there are no easy fixes. Our best hope, as always, is education. After this crisis ends (and it will), we must commit ourselves to reminding new generations how a small viral genome overcame centuries of scientific progress and nearly toppled the world as we know it.The scientific basis for vaccination’s success is the concept of immune memory. Vaccines train our immune systems to fight infections before they invade. For some vaccines, the memory of how to fight lasts a lifetime. For others, it fades, requiring periodic boosts. After COVID-19, will our memory of this pandemic sustain our sense of obligation towards one another, unite us in a shared fight against infectious disease, and encourage a lasting commitment to vaccination? Will our memory fade or will it last forever? For humanity’s sake, I hope it is the latter.",1
"In America, this is what it has come to: Health workers in scrubs standing in a crosswalk, blocking carloads of social-distance protesters.
Hundreds of people gathered in Denver and elsewhere over the weekend, protesting the infringement on their rights—and underscoring America’s politically divided response.Republicans and Democrats in the US have dramatically different perceptions on the risks posed by the virus and stay-at-home orders, Axios notes. Many conservatives live in states with fewer cases, while liberals in big-cities are seeing more death up close.And yet, as some southern US states angle to lift stay-at-home orders, more than two-thirds of Americans agree that a return to normal life is too risky at this point, according to an Axios-Ipsos poll.Previous pandemics stirred protests, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientistsrecounts—for example, during a 1894 smallpox outbreak when immigrants were forcibly removed from their homes and put into isolation hospitals.What’s different here: “Protests against government epidemic policies aren’t entirely rare; a president joining with protestors in his own country, rallying against his own policies, is,” the Scientists say, pointing to Trumps’s tweet to “LIBERATE MICHIGAN.""",1
"Americans are eagerly awaiting the reopening of the country—but despite White House guidelines that foresee a near-future return to normalcy, scientists tend to disagree, the New York Times reports.While plateauing cases in hotspots like New York—achieved by strict quarantine measures—offer some comfort, uncertainty is the only guarantee. The pandemic’s future depends on huge variables including a “carefully staggered” reopening approach, and the timeline of effective treatments and a vaccine.The Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health outlined a reopening plan Friday in a new report tailored to state governors. Report co-author Caitlin Rivers said in a Q&A that while restarting economic activity is a priority, there should be greater emphasis on avoiding a repeat of the conditions that led to the current lockdowns",1
"The coronavirus is spreading from America’s biggest cities to its suburbs, and has begun encroaching on the nation’s rural regions. The virus is believed to have infected millions of citizens and has killed more than 34,000.Yet President Trump this week proposed guidelines for reopening the economy and suggested that a swath of the United States would soon resume something resembling normalcy. For weeks now, the administration’s view of the crisis and our future has been rosier than that of its own medical advisers, and of scientists generally.In truth, it is not clear to anyone where this crisis is leading us. More than 20 experts in public health, medicine, epidemiology and history shared their thoughts on the future during in-depth interviews. When can we emerge from our homes? How long, realistically, before we have a treatment or vaccine? How will we keep the virus at bay?Some felt that American ingenuity, once fully engaged, might well produce advances to ease the burdens. The path forward depends on factors that are certainly difficult but doable, they said: a carefully staggered approach to reopening, widespread testing and surveillance, a treatment that works, adequate resources for health care providers — and eventually an effective vaccine.Still, it was impossible to avoid gloomy forecasts for the next year. The scenario that Mr. Trump has been unrolling at his daily press briefings — that the lockdowns will end soon, that a protective pill is almost at hand, that football stadiums and restaurants will soon be full — is a fantasy, most experts said.
“We face a doleful future,” said Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, a former president of the National Academy of Medicine.He and others foresaw an unhappy population trapped indoors for months, with the most vulnerable possibly quarantined for far longer. They worried that a vaccine would initially elude scientists, that weary citizens would abandon restrictions despite the risks, that the virus would be with us from now on.
“My optimistic side says the virus will ease off in the summer and a vaccine will arrive like the cavalry,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University medical school. “But I’m learning to guard against my essentially optimistic nature.”Most experts believed that once the crisis was over, the nation and its economy would revive quickly. But there would be no escaping a period of intense pain.Exactly how the pandemic will end depends in part on medical advances still to come. It will also depend on how individual Americans behave in the interim. If we scrupulously protect ourselves and our loved ones, more of us will live. If we underestimate the virus, it will find us.
More Americans may die than the White House admits.Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, is arguably the leading cause of death in the United States right now. The virus has killed more than 1,800 Americans almost every day since April 7, and the official toll may be an undercount.By comparison, heart disease typically kills 1,774 Americans a day, and cancer kills 1,641.Yes, the coronavirus curves are plateauing. There are fewer hospital admissions in New York, the center of the epidemic, and fewer Covid-19 patients in I.C.U.s. The daily death toll is still grim, but no longer rising.An epidemiological model produced by the White House originally predicted 100,000 to 240,000 deaths by midsummer. Another model, by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, now puts that figure at 60,000.While this is encouraging news, it masks some significant concerns. The institute’s projection runs through Aug. 4, describing only the first wave of this epidemic. Without a vaccine, the virus is expected to circulate for years, and the death tally will rise over time.The gains to date were achieved only by shutting down the country, a situation that cannot continue indefinitely. The White House’s “phased” plan for reopening will surely raise the death toll no matter how carefully it is executed. The best hope is that fatalities can be held to a minimum.
Reputable longer-term projections for how many Americans will die vary, but they are all grim. Various experts consulted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March predicted that the virus eventually could reach 48 percent to 65 percent of all Americans, with a fatality rate just under 1 percent, and would kill up to 1.7 million of them if nothing were done to stop the spread.A model by researchers at Imperial College London cited by the president on March 30 predicted 2.2 million deaths in the United States by September under the same circumstances.By comparison, about 420,000 Americans died in World War II.The limited data from China are even more discouraging. Its epidemic has been halted — for the moment — and virtually everyone infected in its first wave has died or recovered.China has officially reported about 83,000 cases and 4,632 deaths, which is a fatality rate of over 5 percent. The Trump administration has questioned the figures but has not produced more accurate ones.Fatality rates depend heavily on how overwhelmed hospitals get and what percentage of cases are tested. China’s estimated death rate was 17 percent in the first week of January, when Wuhan was in chaos, according to a Center for Evidence-Based Medicine report, but only 0.7 percent by late February.In this country, hospitals in several cities, including New York, came to the brink of chaos. Officials in both Wuhan and New York had to revise their death counts upward this week when they realized that many people had died at home of Covid-19, strokes, heart attacks or other causes, or because ambulances never came for them.
In fast-moving epidemics, far more victims pour into hospitals or die at home than doctors can test; at the same time, the mildly ill or asymptomatic never get tested. Those two factors distort the true fatality rate in opposite ways. If you don’t know how many people are infected, you don’t know how deadly a virus is.
Only when tens of thousands of antibody tests are done will we know how many silent carriers there may be in the United States. The C.D.C. has suggested it might be 25 percent of those who test positive. Researchers in Iceland said it might be double that.China is also revising its own estimates. In February, a major study concluded that only 1 percent of cases in Wuhan were asymptomatic. New research says perhaps 60 percent were. Our knowledge gaps are still wide enough to make epidemiologists weep.“All models are just models,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, science adviser to the White House coronavirus task force, has said. “When you get new data, you change them.”There may be good news buried in this inconsistency: The virus may also be mutating to cause fewer symptoms. In the movies, viruses become more deadly. In reality, they usually become less so, because asymptomatic strains reach more hosts. Even the 1918 Spanish flu virus eventually faded into the seasonal H1N1 flu.At the moment, however, we do not know exactly how transmissible or lethal the virus is. But refrigerated trucks parked outside hospitals tell us all we need to know: It is far worse than a bad flu season.No one knows exactly what percentage of Americans have been infected so far — estimates have ranged from 3 percent to 10 percent — but it is likely a safe bet that at least 300 million of us are still vulnerable.Until a vaccine or another protective measure emerges, there is no scenario, epidemiologists agreed, in which it is safe for that many people to suddenly come out of hiding. If Americans pour back out in force, all will appear quiet for perhaps three weeks.

Then the emergency rooms will get busy again.“There’s this magical thinking saying, ‘We’re all going to hunker down for a while and then the vaccine we need will be available,’” said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.In his wildly popular March 19 article in Medium, “Coronavirus: The Hammer and the Dance,” Tomas Pueyo correctly predicted the national lockdown, which he called the hammer, and said it would lead to a new phase, which he called the dance, in which essential parts of the economy could reopen, including some schools and some factories with skeleton crews.Every epidemiological model envisions something like the dance. Each assumes the virus will blossom every time too many hosts emerge and force another lockdown. Then the cycle repeats. On the models, the curves of rising and falling deaths resemble a row of shark teeth.Surges are inevitable, the models predict, even when stadiums, churches, theaters, bars and restaurants remain closed, all travelers from abroad are quarantined for 14 days, and domestic travel is tightly restricted to prevent high-intensity areas from reinfecting low-intensity ones.The tighter the restrictions, experts say, the fewer the deaths and the longer the periods between lockdowns. Most models assume states will eventually do widespread temperature checks, rapid testing and contact tracing, as is routine in Asia.Even the “Opening Up America Again” guidelines Mr. Trump issued on Thursday have three levels of social distancing, and recommend that vulnerable Americans stay hidden. The plan endorses testing, isolation and contact tracing — but does not specify how these measures will be paid for, or how long it will take to put them in place.On Friday, none of that stopped the president from contradicting his own message by sending out tweets encouraging protesters in Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia to fight their states’ shutdowns.China did not allow Wuhan, Nanjing or other cities to reopen until intensive surveillance found zero new cases for 14 straight days, the virus’s incubation period. Compared with China or Italy, the United States is still a playground.Americans can take domestic flights, drive where they want, and roam streets and parks. Despite restrictions, everyone seems to know someone discreetly arranging play dates for children, holding backyard barbecues or meeting people on dating apps.Partly as a result, the country has seen up to 30,000 new case infections each day. “People need to realize that it's not safe to play poker wearing bandannas,” Dr. Schaffner said.Even with rigorous measures, Asian countries have had trouble keeping the virus under control.China, which has reported about 100 new infections per day, recently closed all the country’s movie theaters again. Singapore has closed all schools and nonessential workplaces. Japan recently declared a state of emergency. (South Korea has struggled at times, too, but on Sunday reported only eight new cases, the first single-digit increase in two months.)Resolve to Save Lives, a public health advocacy group run by Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C., has published detailed and strict criteria for when the economy can reopen and when it must be closed.Reopening requires declining cases for 14 days, the tracing of 90 percent of contacts, an end to health care worker infections, recuperation places for mild cases and many other hard-to-reach goals.“We need to reopen the faucet gradually, not allow the floodgates to reopen,” Dr. Frieden said. “This is a time to work to make that day come sooner.”Immunity will become a societal advantage.Imagine an America divided into two classes: those who have recovered from infection with the coronavirus and presumably have some immunity to it; and those who are still vulnerable.“It will be a frightening schism,” Dr. David Nabarro, a World Health Organization special envoy on Covid-19, predicted. “Those with antibodies will be able to travel and work, and the rest will be discriminated against.”Already, people with presumed immunity are very much in demand, asked to donate their blood for antibodies and doing risky medical jobs fearlessly.Soon the government will have to invent a way to certify who is truly immune. A test for IgG antibodies, which are produced once immunity is established, would make sense, said Dr. Daniel R. Lucey, an expert on pandemics at Georgetown University’s law school. Many companies are working on them.Dr. Fauci has said the White House was discussing certificates like those proposed in Germany. China uses cellphone QR codes linked to the owner’s personal details so others cannot borrow them.The California adult-film industry pioneered a similar idea a decade ago. Actors use a cellphone app to prove they have tested H.I.V. negative in the last 14 days, and producers can verify the information on a password-protected website.As Americans stuck in lockdown see their immune neighbors resuming their lives and perhaps even taking the jobs they lost, it is not hard to imagine the enormous temptation to join them through self-infection, experts predicted. Younger citizens in particular will calculate that risking a serious illness may still be better than impoverishment and isolation.“My daughter, who is a Harvard economist, keeps telling me her age group needs to have Covid-19 parties to develop immunity and keep the economy going,” said Dr. Michele Barry, who directs the Center for Innovation in Global Health at Stanford University.The comment, she explained later, was meant in jest. Still, it has happened before.In the 1980s, Cuba successfully contained its small AIDS epidemic by brutally forcing everyone who tested positive into isolation camps. Inside, however, the residents had their own bungalows, food, medical care, salaries, theater troupes and art classes.Dozens of Cuba’s homeless youths infected themselves through sex or blood injections to get in, said Dr. Jorge Pérez Ávila, an AIDS specialist who is Cuba’s version of Dr. Fauci. Many died before antiretroviral therapy was introduced.It would be a gamble for American youth, too. The obese and immunocompromised are clearly at risk, but even slim, healthy young Americans have died of Covid-19.The virus can be kept in check, but only with expanded resources.The next two years will proceed in fits and starts, experts said. As more immune people get back to work, more of the economy will recover.But if too many people get infected at once, new lockdowns will become inevitable. To avoid that, widespread testing will be imperative.Dr. Fauci has said “the virus will tell us” when it’s safe. He means that once a national baseline of hundreds of thousands of daily tests is established across the nation, any viral spread can be spotted when the percentage of positive results rises.Detecting rising fevers as they are mapped by Kinsa’s smart thermometers may give an earlier signal, Dr. Schaffner said.But diagnostic testing has been troubled from the beginning. Despite assurances from the White House, doctors and patients continue to complain of delays and shortages.To keep the virus in check, several experts insisted, the country also must start isolating all the ill — including mild cases.In this country, patients who test positive are asked to stay in their homes but keep away from their families.Television news has been filled with recuperating personalities like CNN’s Chris Cuomo, sweating alone in his basement while his wife left food atop the stairs, his children waved and the dogs hung back.But even Mr. Cuomo ended up illustrating why the W.H.O. strongly opposes home isolation. On Wednesday, he revealed that his wife had the virus.“If I was forced to select only one intervention, it would be the rapid isolation of all cases,” said Dr. Bruce Aylward, who led the W.H.O. observer team to China.In China, anyone testing positive, no matter how mild their symptoms, was required to immediately enter an infirmary-style hospital — often set up in a gymnasium or community center outfitted with oxygen tanks and CT scanners.There, they recuperated under the eyes of nurses. That reduced the risk to families, and being with other victims relieved some patients’ fears. Nurses even led dance and exercise classes to raise spirits, and help victims clear their lungs and keep their muscle tone.Still, experts were divided on the idea of such wards. Dr. Fineberg co-wrote a New York Times Op-Ed article calling for mandatory but “humane quarantine processes.”By contrast, Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, opposed the idea, saying: “I don’t trust our government to remove people from their families by force.”Ultimately, suppressing a virus requires testing all the contacts of every known case. But the United States is far short of that goal.Someone working in a restaurant or factory may have dozens or even hundreds of contacts. In China’s Sichuan Province, for example, each known case had an average of 45 contacts.The C.D.C. has about 600 contact tracers and, until recently, state and local health departments employed about 1,600, mostly for tracing syphilis and tuberculosis cases.China hired and trained 9,000 in Wuhan alone. Dr. Frieden recently estimated that the United States will need at least 300,000.Even though limited human trials of three candidates — two here and one in China — have already begun, Dr. Fauci has repeatedly said that any effort to make a vaccine will take at least a year to 18 months.All the experts familiar with vaccine production agreed that even that timeline was optimistic. Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccinologist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, noted that the record is four years, for the mumps vaccine.Researchers differed sharply over what should be done to speed the process. Modern biotechnology techniques using RNA or DNA platforms make it possible to develop candidate vaccines faster than ever before.But clinical trials take time, in part because there is no way to rush the production of antibodies in the human body.Also, for unclear reasons, some previous vaccine candidates against coronaviruses like SARS have triggered “antibody-dependent enhancement,” which makes recipients more susceptible to infection, rather than less. In the past, vaccines against H.I.V. and dengue have unexpectedly done the same.A new vaccine is usually first tested in fewer than 100 young, healthy volunteers. If it appears safe and produces antibodies, thousands more volunteers — in this case, probably front-line workers at the highest risk — will get either it or a placebo in what is called a Phase 3 trial.It is possible to speed up that process with “challenge trials.” Scientists vaccinate small numbers of volunteers, wait until they develop antibodies, and then “challenge” them with a deliberate infection to see if the vaccine protects them.Challenge trials are used only when a disease is completely curable, such as malaria or typhoid fever. Normally, it is ethically unthinkable to challenge subjects with a disease with no cure, such as Covid-19.But in these abnormal times, several experts argued that putting a few Americans at high risk for fast results could be more ethical than leaving millions at risk for years.“Fewer get harmed if you do a challenge trial in a few people than if you do a Phase 3 trial in thousands,” said Dr. Lipsitch, who recently published a paper advocating challenge trials in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. Almost immediately, he said, he heard from volunteers.Others were deeply uncomfortable with that idea. “I think it’s very unethical — but I can see how we might do it,” said Dr. Lucey.The hidden danger of challenge trials, vaccinologists explained, is that they recruit too few volunteers to show whether a vaccine creates enhancement, since it may be a rare but dangerous problem.“Challenge trials won’t give you an answer on safety,” said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. “It may be a big problem.”Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a virologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, suggested an alternative strategy. Pick at least two vaccine candidates, briefly test them in humans and do challenge trials in monkeys. Start making the winner immediately, even while widening the human testing to look for hidden problems.As arduous as testing a vaccine is, producing hundreds of millions of doses is even tougher, experts said.
Most American vaccine plants produce only about 5 million to 10 million doses a year, needed largely by the 4 million babies born and 4 million people who reach age 65 annually, said Dr. R. Gordon Douglas Jr., a former president of Merck’s vaccine division.But if a vaccine is invented, the United States could need 300 million doses — or 600 million if two shots are required. And just as many syringes.
“People have to start thinking big,” Dr. Douglas said. “With that volume, you’ve got to start cranking it out pretty soon.”Flu vaccine plants are large, but those that grow the vaccines in chicken eggs are not suitable for modern vaccines, which grow in cell broths, he said.European countries have plants but will need them for their own citizens. China has a large vaccine industry, and may be able to expand it over the coming months. It might be able to make vaccines for the United States, experts said. But captive customers must pay whatever price the seller asks, and the safety and efficacy standards of some Chinese companies are imperfect.India and Brazil also have large vaccine industries. If the virus moves rapidly through their crowded populations, they may lose millions of citizens but achieve widespread herd immunity well before the United States does. In that case, they might have spare vaccine plant capacity.Alternatively, suggested Arthur M. Silverstein, a retired medical historian at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the government might take over and sterilize existing liquor or beer plants, which have large fermentation vats.“Any distillery could be converted,” he said.Treatments are likely to arrive first.In the short term, experts were more optimistic about treatments than vaccines. Several felt that so-called convalescent serum could work.The basic technique has been used for over a century: Blood is drawn from people who have recovered from a disease, then filtered to remove everything but the antibodies. The antibody-rich immunoglobulin is injected into patients.The obstacle is that there are now relatively few survivors to harvest blood from.In the pre-vaccine era, antibodies were “farmed” in horses and sheep. But that process was hard to keep sterile, and animal proteins sometimes triggered allergic reactions.The modern alternative is monoclonal antibodies. These treatment regimens, which recently came very close to conquering the Ebola epidemic in eastern Congo, are the most likely short-term game changer, experts said.The most effective antibodies are chosen, and the genes that produce them are spliced into a benign virus that will grow in a cellular broth.But, as with vaccines, growing and purifying monoclonal antibodies takes time. In theory, with enough production, they could be used not just to save lives but to protect front-line workers.Antibodies can last for weeks before breaking down — how long depends on many factors, Dr. Silverstein noted — and they cannot kill virus that is already hidden inside cells.Having a daily preventive pill would be an even better solution, because pills can be synthesized in factories far faster than vaccines or antibodies can be grown and purified.But even if one were invented, production would have to ramp up until it was as ubiquitous as aspirin, so 300 million Americans could take it daily.
Mr. Trump has mentioned hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin so often that his news conferences sound like infomercials. But all the experts agreed with Dr. Fauci that no decision should be made until clinical trials are completed.Some recalled that in the 1950s inadequate testing of thalidomide caused thousands of children to be born with malformed limbs. More than one hydroxychloroquine study has been halted after patients who got high doses developed abnormal heart rhythms.“I doubt anyone will tolerate high doses, and there are vision issues if it accumulates,” Dr. Barry said. Others were just as harsh, especially about Mr. Trump’s idea of combining a chloroquine with azithromycin.“It’s total nonsense,” said Dr. Luciana Borio, a former director of medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council. “I told my family, if I get Covid, do not give me this combo.”Chloroquine might protect patients hospitalized with pneumonia against lethal cytokine storms because it damps down immune reactions, several doctors said.
That does not, however, make it useful for preventing infections, as Mr. Trump has implied it would be, because it has no known antiviral properties.Several antivirals, including remdesivir, favipiravir and baloxavir, are being tested against the coronavirus; the latter two are flu drugs.Trials of various combinations in China are set to issue results by next month, but they will be small and possibly inconclusive because doctors there ran out of patients to test. End dates for most trials in the United States are not yet set.Goodbye, ‘America First.’Previously unthinkable societal changes have taken place already. Schools and business have closed in every state, and tens of millions have applied for unemployment. Taxes and mortgage payments are delayed, and foreclosures forbidden.Stimulus checks, intended to offset the crisis, began landing in checking accounts this week, making much of America, temporarily, a welfare state. Food banks are opening across the country, and huge lines have formed.A public health crisis of this magnitude requires international cooperation on a scale not seen in decades. Yet Mr. Trump is moving to defund the W.H.O., the only organization capable of coordinating such a response.And he spent most of this year antagonizing China, which now has the world’s most powerful functioning economy and may become the dominant supplier of drugs and vaccines. China has used the pandemic to extend its global influence, and says it has sent medical gear and equipment to nearly 120 countries.
A major recipient is the United States, through Project Airbridge, an air-cargo operation overseen by Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.This is not a world in which “America First” is a viable strategy, several experts noted.“If President Trump cares about stepping up the public health efforts here, he should look for avenues to collaborate with China and stop the insults,” said Nicholas Mulder, an economic historian at Cornell University. He has called Mr. Kushner’s project “Lend-Lease in reverse,” a reference to American military aid to other countries during World War II.Dr. Osterholm was even blunter. “If we alienate the Chinese with our rhetoric, I think it will come back to bite us,” he said.“What if they come up with the first vaccine? They have a choice about who they sell it to. Are we top of the list? Why would we be?”Once the pandemic has passed, the national recovery may be swift. The economy rebounded after both world wars, Dr. Mulder noted.The psychological fallout will be harder to gauge. The isolation and poverty caused by a long shutdown may drive up rates of domestic abuse, depression and suicide.Even political perspectives may shift. Initially, the virus heavily hit Democratic cities like Seattle, New York and Detroit. But as it spreads through the country, it will spare no one.Even voters in Republican-leaning states who do not blame Mr. Trump for America’s lack of preparedness or for limiting access to health insurance may change their minds if they see friends and relatives die.In one of the most provocative analyses in his follow-up article, “Coronavirus: Out of Many, One,” Mr. Pueyo analyzed Medicare and census data on age and obesity in states that recently resisted shutdowns and counties that voted Republican in 2016.He calculated that those voters could be 30 percent more likely to die of the virus.In the periods after both wars, Dr. Mulder noted, society and incomes became more equal. Funds created for veterans’ and widows’ pensions led to social safety nets, measures like the G.I. Bill and V.A. home loans were adopted, unions grew stronger, and tax benefits for the wealthy withered.If a vaccine saves lives, many Americans may become less suspicious of conventional medicine and more accepting of science in general — including climate change, experts said.The blue skies that have shone above American cities during this lockdown era could even become permanent.",1
"More than 27,000 New Yorkers have died since March 11 — 20,900 more than would be expected over this period and thousands more than have been captured by official coronavirus death statistics.As of Sunday, the city had attributed 16,673 deaths to coronavirus, either because people had tested positive for the virus, or because the circumstances of their death meant that city health officials believed the virus to be the most likely cause of death.But there remains a large gap between the 16,673 figure and the total deaths above typical levels in the last six and a half weeks: more than 4,200 people whose deaths are not captured by the official coronavirus toll.The recent death count reached six times the normal number of deaths for the city at this time of year, a surge in deaths much larger than what could be attributed to normal seasonal variations from influenza, heart disease or other more common causes. The city’s largest mass casualty event in recent memory, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, claimed only a small fraction as many lives.It is too soon to know the precise causes of death for New Yorkers in this period. Although many of the deaths not currently attributed to coronavirus may represent an undercount of the outbreak’s direct toll, the broader effects of the pandemic might have also increased deaths indirectly. Throughout the city, emergency rooms have been overcrowded, ambulance response has been slowed, and many residents might have been reluctant to seek medical care because of fears of contracting the virus. Hospitals around the country have reported reductions in admission for heart attacks, one sign that some people may be dying at home from ailments they would survive during more normal times.The measurements in our chart rely on a New York Times analysis of mortality data from the city’s Department of Health and from the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They capture the number of New York City residents who have died each week since January 2017. The total number of deaths for the period from the start of the outbreak March 11 through April 25 comes from the city health department. The way in which these deaths are distributed by week is an approximation based on how mortality data has lagged in the past.Even with these high totals, the recent numbers in our charts are most likely an undercount of all deaths in the city. In normal times, death certificates take time to be processed and collected, and complete death tallies can take weeks to become final. But even if the current count is perfect, roughly 27,600 New Yorkers have died of all causes since the beginning of the epidemic. That’s about 20,900 more than is typical.",1
"Social media is already filling up with misinformation about a Covid-19 vaccine, months or years before one even exists.The other night, midway through watching a clip from “Plandemic” — a documentary that went viral on social media last week, spreading baseless lies and debunked nonsense about the coronavirus to millions of Americans overnight — I had a terrifying thought:What if we get a Covid-19 vaccine and half the country refuses to take it?It occurred to me that all the misinformation we’ve seen so far — the 0 rumors that 5G cellphone towers fuel the coronavirus, that drinking bleach or injecting UV rays can cure it, that Dr. Anthony Fauci is part of an anti-Trump conspiracy — may be just the warm-up act for a much bigger information war when an effective vaccine becomes available to the public. This war could pit public health officials and politicians against an anti-vaccination movement that floods social media with misinformation, conspiracy theories and propaganda aimed at convincing people that the vaccine is a menace rather than a lifesaving, economy-rescuing miracle.
Scariest of all? It could actually work.I’ve been following the anti-vaccine community on and off for years, watching its members operate in private Facebook groups and Instagram accounts, and have found that they are much more organized and strategic than many of their critics believe. They are savvy media manipulators, effective communicators and experienced at exploiting the weaknesses of social media platforms. (Just one example: Shortly after Facebook and YouTube began taking down copies of “Plandemic” for violating their rules, I saw people in anti-vaccine groups editing it in subtle ways to evade the platforms’ automated enforcement software and reposting it.)In short, the anti-vaxxers have been practicing for this. And I’m worried that they will be unusually effective in sowing doubts about a Covid-19 vaccine for several reasons.First, because of the pandemic’s urgency, any promising Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be fast-tracked through the testing and approval process. It may not go through years of clinical trials and careful studies of possible long-term side effects, the way other drugs do. That could create an opening for anti-vaccine activists to claim that it is untested and dangerous, and to spin reasonable concerns about the vaccine into widespread, unfounded fears about its safety.Second, if a vaccine does emerge, there is a good chance that leading health organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the World Health Organization will have a hand in producing or distributing it. If that’s the case, anti-vaccine activists, who have been crusading against these groups for years, will have plenty of material stockpiled to try to discredit them. They are already taking aim at Mr. Gates with baseless conspiracy theories claiming that he created and is trying to profit from the virus. These theories will be amplified, and the attempts to discredit leading virus research efforts will intensify as the vaccine nears.Third, if and when a Covid-19 vaccine is approved for widespread use, people may be required to take it before being allowed to fly on certain airlines, attend certain schools or enter certain businesses. That’s a good idea, public health-wise, but it would play into some of the worst fears of the anti-vaccine movement.Mandatory vaccination has been an especially potent talking point for anti-vaccine activists, some of whom have rebranded themselves “pro-choice” when it comes to vaccines. And years of battling states and school districts over mandatory vaccine policies have given them a playbook for creating a tangle of legal roadblocks and damaging publicity campaigns.I wanted to understand if my fears about a vaccine-related information war were valid, so I reached out to Neil Johnson and Rhys Leahy, two researchers at George Washington University. On Wednesday, their study of the online anti-vaccine movement was published in the science journal Nature.The study, which mapped the vaccine conversation on Facebook during the 2019 measles outbreak, found that there were nearly three times as many active anti-vaccination communities as pro-vaccination communities. In addition, they found that while pro-vaccine pages tended to have more followers, anti-vaccine pages were faster-growing.“We expected to find a strong core of ‘vanilla’ science — people saying that vaccines are good for you — but that’s not what we found at all,” Mr. Johnson told me. “We found a real struggle online, where the public health establishment and its supporters are almost fighting in the wrong place.”The researchers found that Facebook pages pushing accurate pro-vaccine information were mostly clustered in an insular group, while the anti-vaccine pages treated vaccine resistance as a kind of political campaign, and used different messages to reach different types of undecided “voters.” A page promoting holistic health remedies might start seeding doubts about vaccines among liberal yoga moms, while a page promoting resistance to government-mandated vaccines might appeal to conservatives and libertarians.“Public health advocacy groups tend to be monolithic, sending one message” that vaccines are safe and effective, Ms. Leahy said. “The anti-vax movement is really diverse.”There is some reason for hope. Recent surveys have suggested that most Americans would take a Covid-19 vaccine if one were available today. Even politicians who have expressed skepticism about vaccines in the past, including President Trump, are rooting for one that can prevent the disease. And some public health experts I spoke to said public pressure to end the pandemic and return to normal life might overpower anti-vaccine activism.“People are seeing the toll of Covid-19 all around,” said Kasisomayajula Viswanath, a professor of health communication at the Harvard School of Public Health. “My guess is that if there is a successful vaccine, especially in the absence of treatment, people may discount the anti-vaccine groups.”
But public acceptance of a Covid-19 vaccine is far from a sure thing. And seeing platforms like Facebook and YouTube struggle to contain the spread of videos like “Plandemic” makes me worry that when the time comes to persuade billions of people to take a critical coronavirus vaccine, our public health officials and social media companies will be outgunned by a well-oiled anti-vaccine movement that has already polluted the air with misinformation and conspiracy theories.We can prevent that, but only if we start laying the groundwork before it’s too late. Organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the W.H.O. need to understand the dynamics of online anti-vaccination communities and start waging a hearts-and-minds campaign to restore faith in the medical establishment while a vaccine is being developed. Social media companies need to take the threat of vaccine-related misinformation seriously and devote tremendous resources to stopping its spread. And those of us who believe in vaccines need to realize that we may not be in the majority for long and do everything we can to reach the people in our lives who might be susceptible to anti-vaccine propaganda.To recover from this pandemic, we need to mobilize a pro-vaccine movement that is as devoted, as internet-savvy and as compelling as the anti-vaccine movement is for its adherents. We need to do it quickly, with all the creativity and urgency of the scientists who are developing the vaccine itself. Millions of lives and trillions of dollars in economic activity may depend not just on producing a vaccine, but on persuading people to accept it.",1
"The coronavirus is providing a global rallying cry for conspiracy theorists and far-right extremists on both sides of the Atlantic.
People seizing on the pandemic range from white supremacists and anti-vaxxers in the U.S. to fascist and anti-refugee groups across Europe, according to a POLITICO review of thousands social media posts and interviews with misinformation experts tracking their online activities. They also include far-right populists on both continents who had previously tried to coordinate their efforts after the 2016 American presidential election.
Not all online groups peddling messages on the pandemic have links to the far right, but those extremists have become especially vocal in using the outbreak to push their political agenda at a time of deepening public uncertainty and economic trauma. They are piggybacking on social media to promote coronavirus-related themes drawn from multiple sources — among them, Russian and Chinese disinformation campaigns, the Trump administration’s musings about the coronavirus’ origins and anti-Muslim themes from India’s nationalist ruling party.“Honestly, it’s a dream come true for any and every hate group, snake oil salesman and everything in between,” said Tijana Cvjetićanin, a fact-checker in the Balkans who has watched ultranationalist groups promoting hate-filled messages on social media about the coronavirus, often against Jewish communities.Civil rights advocates have warned for months that the coronavirus could aid recruiting for the most extreme white-supremacist and neo-Nazi groups — those actively rooting for society’s collapse. Some online researchers say they also worry about the barrage of 0 messages from extremist groups feeding what the U.N. has dubbed an “infodemic” that makes it hard to separate fact from fiction.Opponents of government lockdown orders have used online platforms to organize protests across the U.S., including rallies where activists displayed guns inside Michigan’s state capitol. In Europe, rumors linking the coronavirus to 5G wireless technology have led to dozens of arson attacks on telecommunications masts — a phenomenon that now appears to have spread to Canada.“It's like hitting conspiracy bingo,” said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab, which is tracking coronavirus misinformation.From 4chan to Facebook.As the world economy craters and the coronavirus’ global death toll ticks past 280,000 people, extremist messages are finding fertile ground on fringe online platforms like 4chan, Telegram and a gamer hangout called Discord. From there, such harmful content can make its way to mainstream sites like Facebook and Google-owned YouTube — each boasting roughly 2 billion users apiece — despite the companies’ attempts to weed out violent or dangerous content.
Facebook said last week that one collection of fake accounts and pages it removed in April — tied to two anti-immigrant websites in the U.S. — had drawn more than 200,000 followers with messages including the hashtag “#ChinaVirus” and a 0 claim that the coronavirus mainly kills white people. Twitter announced Monday that it would begin more aggressively labeling tweets that contain misleading or harmful coronavirus information.But plenty of other fake coronavirus content continues to thrive online. That includes a slickly produced online video, called “Plandemic,” that garnered millions of views across YouTube, Twitter and Facebook over the weekend by promoting bogus medical cures and other conspiracy theories tied to the coronavirus. The video remains in wide circulation.
One coronavirus-related term, “Coronachan,” has also exploded on social media, first emerging in January and drawing more than 120,000 shares on Twitter in one week in late April, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank that tracks extremist groups. (The term is a play on the name of 4chan, a message board that is a favorite gathering spot for the global far right.) In Germany, Telegram groups where influential extremists and far-right activists attack vulnerable groups have doubled their number of followers, to more than 100,000 participants since February, according to a review by POLITICO of those accounts.The themes of far-right posts include long-standing grievances, including allegations that migrants spread disease, support for President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall, antagonism toward the EU or opposition to gun control. One online rumor, accusing Microsoft founder Bill Gates of creating the coronavirus, echoes centuries-old conspiracy theories and Anti-Semitic tropes about global elites pulling the world’s strings.“These aren’t new lines they are spinning,” said Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate. “They will use anything they can, whether it’s coronavirus or something else, to bring people into their radical world.”Public figures helping stoke the fires include French nationalist leader Marine Le Pen, whose Facebook account has more than 1.5 million followers, and Trump, who has defended his use of the term “Chinese virus” and pushed the theory that the disease may have come from a lab in China, despite pushback from his intelligence and defense agencies.Extremist groups on the two continents have tried before to coordinate their messaging, with middling success.
After Trump’s surprise victory in 2016, far-right online communities sprouted up across the U.S. and Europe, at first using online platforms like Facebook and Google before shifting their focus to smaller, less-regulated networks to share conspiracy theories or organize protests.
Americans like Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, also tried to export U.S.-style online tactics in hopes of uniting European right-wing groups like Italy’s Northern League party and Le Pen’s National Rally in France, though, as POLITICO reported last year, he struggled to win over movements on the Continent.Now, as the coronavirus gives the far right a new impetus to find audiences, many European activists are wielding the same U.S.-style tactics they have spent years learning to emulate, including the creation of online “meme banks” of photos designed to spread widely. That leaves them less in need of outside help, according to researchers tracking their movements.“Europe’s far-right no longer needs additional resources from its transatlantic supporters,” said Chloe Colliver, who heads the digital research unit at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.Blaming minorities. It does not take much digging through the online platforms to find far-right messages on the health crisis.In Italy, extremist news outlets have flooded social media with reports blaming that country’s devastating coronavirus outbreak on migrants, including an online attack that singled out a Pakistani employee at a Chinese restaurant in a northern Italian town.In France, activists called for sending non-white populations back to their “home” countries, while Le Pen, the far-right leader, alleged on Facebook that mosques had have “taken advantage of the confinement orders” by blaring “the muezzin's call to Islamic prayer” on loudspeakers.Tommy Robinson, the British anti-immigration activist, has promoted the “#GermJihad” hashtag and reposted online messages from members of India’s ruling nationalist BJP party to his more than 36,000 followers on Telegram, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate’s review of his posts.Others, on sites like Facebook and Reddit, have alleged that the Chinese created the coronavirus as a bioweapon to attack the U.S. economy, and will reap the windfall if they are not stopped. “China will become even more brazen and take down western economies with more filth in the future,” one Reddit user wrote.Those claims go much further than the recent speculation by Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the coronavirus originated in a government lab in Wuhan, China. (The president said this month that he thinks the Chinese “made a horrible mistake and they didn’t want to admit it.”)
While some online far-right users have jumped on Trump’s messages, others had already been promoting anti-China rhetoric before senior U.S. politicians began railing on Beijing, according to a review of social media posts from early February.Attacking governments.Extremists are also using the coronavirus to call for resistance against their governments.In Telegram channels with tens of thousands of followers, users mostly in the U.S. urged people to take up arms to protest the lockdowns and protect their civil liberties, sometimes posting photos of themselves dressed in biohazard suits and carrying automatic weapons, according to research from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.European far-right groups also have called for national governments to reclaim their power from the EU — a message primarily focused on countries like Greece, Spain and Italy where some people remain bitter about how the bloc treated them during the 2008 financial crisis. Those countries similarly have seen a spike in Russian disinformation campaigns, mostly through Kremlin-backed media outlets, aimed at sowing doubt about Europe’s response to the coronavirus, according to a recent review conducted by EU disinformation officials obtained by POLITICO.A far more extreme incident occurred in the U.S. in March, when the FBI shot and killed a Missouri man who agents said had been plotting to blow up a hospital to call attention to his white supremacist beliefs. The man, who had posted anti-Semitic remarks on Telegram hours before being killed, had chosen the target because of ""media attention on the health sector"" during the pandemic, the bureau said in a statement quoted by NBC News.Misinformation experts at the Oxford Internet Institute documented Facebook groups across 33 states aimed at instigating opposition to quarantine measures that rob people of their freedoms and ability to earn a living, according to Aliaksandr Herasimenka, a postdoctoral researcher. Some had fewer than 10,000 members, while others had grown much larger.“The similarity and design of their Facebook groups suggests that many of these protests across individual states are related to each other,” said Herasimenka. It “might be directed, not necessarily managed, but directed or inspired by some centralized lobby groups that we don't know exactly what they are.”Facebook has removed some of the protests from its network after determining they had violated state orders by encouraging people to take actions that could spread the coronavirus. But the policy hasn’t applied consistently across the social network, and Facebook has been adamant that it is not policing people’s political opinions. The company has often left it to a global network of independent fact-checkers to debunk the worst online offenders or counter misinformation by pointing people to credible sources.Several of the recently created U.S. Facebook groups have been spearheaded by the Dorr family, brothers who manage a series of aggressively U.S. pro-gun organizations, The Washington Post reported last month. One Dorr-connected private group called Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine attracted 118,000 members; its Pennsylvania affiliate counts 89,000, according to a review of these Facebook groups. The Dorrs did not respond to requests for comment through their advocacy organizations.“The audience for this stuff isn't the average American news consumer and I'm not even sure the audience is the average person stuck at home sheltering in place,” said Philip Howard, director of the Oxford Internet Institute. “It’s people who are reluctant to take any advice or instructions from the government at any time, whether it's about guidelines on what kinds of guns you can have or whether it's health-related instructions to stay at home.”
'There's only one conversation'. The anti-vaccine movement on both continents has also latched onto the coronavirus pandemic.Media Matters for America, a liberal media watchdog, found posts within U.S. Facebook groups claiming the pandemic is an effort to force people into accepting vaccines and, perhaps, even a surreptitious plot to inject people with microchips. Similar messages appeared in WhatsApp messages shared widely in Italy, which has a long-standing anti-vaxxer community, while groups in France have called for a boycott of any government-backed coronavirus vaccine program.U.S. anti-vaccine groups also organized an anti-lockdown rally this month outside California’s state capitol and have taken part in protests in New York, Colorado and Texas, using their opposition to state-ordered shutdowns as part of a broader message about personal “freedom,” The New York Times reported.
Other coronavirus themes emerging online include long-running conspiracy theories blaming the “global elites” for much of the world’s ills, particularly focusing on George Soros, the Hungarian-born billionaire who has long been a target for right-wing and anti-Semitic groups.Since late January, attacks against Soros and his fellow billionaire Gates have shifted to accusing the men of either spreading the coronavirus or capitalizing on it to push a pro-vaccine agenda. Some Facebook users in private online groups seen by POLITICO also questioned whether Gates was also Jewish. Gates, who has made global public health a priority of his philanthropic efforts, has drawn their attention because of a 2015 video in which he discussed the dangers of a future global pandemic.
“Diseases have long been used to promote disinformation,” said Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, the social media analysis firm, who has tracked the spread of coronavirus extremist content.“But right now, there’s only one conversation that everyone is having, and that’s about the coronavirus,” he added. “The disinformation actors know that as well, and they are trying to take advantage.”",1
"A documentary-style video called 'Plandemic: The Hidden Agenda Behind COVID-19' has been removed by social media platforms after peddling potentially dangerous conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic.The 26-minute video has reportedly been viewed millions of times across Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other websites despite its misleading claims, according to data from social media tracking tool BuzzSumo.The video is said to be the first part of an upcoming documentary, according to California production company Elevate Films, which did not respond to CTVNews.ca's request for comment. It consists of an interview between filmmaker Mikki Willis, whose other videos highlight conspiracy theories, and Dr. Judy Mikovits, a former scientist at the National Cancer Institute in the U.S.The documentary is about Mikovits' theories that the coronavirus pandemic was planned. In the video, she claims that the virus was created in a laboratory, that wearing masks actually makes people sick, and that flu vaccines increase people’s odds of contracting COVID-19. She also makes repeated accusations against Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the lead members of the Trump administration's White House Coronavirus Task Force.No medical or scientific evidence exists to support these or any of Mikovits' claims in the video.LABORATORY THEORY.One of Mikovits' main claims is that the coronavirus was created and manipulated in laboratories in China and the U.S.Despite previous reports that U.S. officials were investigating the possibility that the virus was secretly manufactured in a Chinese lab, there is no scientific evidence to support those theories.A study by researchers from several public health organizations published March 17 in the journal Nature Medicine found that the virus, when tested by computer simulations, does not appear to bind well to human cells. The researchers determined that if someone wanted to create a dangerous virus capable of spreading among humans, their own simulations would show that this virus simply wouldn’t work.""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" researchers wrote in the article.Scientists who have studied the virus point to bats as the likeliest source of transmission to humans, suggesting that COVID-19 was created by nature, not humans. The earliest reported cases of COVID-19 were linked to a live animal market in Wuhan that sold exotic species, bolstering this research.Mikovits also claims that COVID-19 was derived from the SARS virus. While the novel coronavirus is similar to SARS -- both originated from bats, cause respiratory illness, and spread through coughs and sneezes -- SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a new disease, according to a study published in The Lancet.
According to several independent studies, the virus's genetic structure closely resembles one that already exists in horseshoe bats in China's Hunan province.
Bats have an unusually high capacity to harbour viruses, and scientists believe the virus may have spread from bats to an intermediary animal -- possibly stray dogs, snakes or pangolins -- before infecting humans.MASKS DO NOT 'ACTIVATE' THE VIRUS.In the video, Mikovits alleges that wearing a face mask can ""activate"" the coronavirus. She says that people who wear masks are becoming sick from their own ""reactivated coronavirus expressions."" There is no evidence to support this.According to health professionals, wearing a non-medical face mask may prevent the spread of the coronavirus; it does not make people more susceptible to it. Public health officials have recommended that people wear homemade face masks when they’re out in public, especially when physical distancing may be difficult, such as in grocery stores or on public transit. This is to protect others around the wearer because there is evidence the virus can be spread among asymptomatic individuals, or those who don't have any symptoms of COVID-19.HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE DEBATE.Hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug dubbed a ""game changer"" by U.S. President Donald Trump for its potential ability to fight the new coronavirus, was found to be no more effective than standard treatment in a small Chinese study.However, in 'Plandemic,' Mikovits repeatedly pushes it as ""effective against these families of viruses.""While some studies have found that hydroxychloroquine could mitigate some symptoms of COVID-19, other research has found no such evidence.Health Canada issued a warning in April of the possible side effects of the drug. In the health advisory, Health Canada said it is concerned people may be purchasing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent COVID-19 and that the drugs should not be taken unless prescribed and under supervision of a physician.Health Canada said that the drugs can lead to dizziness, fainting, seizures, liver or kidney problems, and a potentially fatal irregular heart rate.There are more than 50 studies in the works on hydroxychloroquine, including in Canada, but health officials say it is too soon to known whether the drug is a viable treatment.There is currently no accepted cure or vaccine for COVID-19.ANTI-VACCINATION ANGLE.Mikovits claims that ""the flu vaccines increase the odds by 36 per cent of getting COVID-19."" She backs up this claim by citing a study published in January in the peer-reviewed journal Vaccine. The study looked at personnel in the U.S. Defense Department between 2017 and 2018 and found that the odds of getting coronaviruses were greater for vaccinated officials than unvaccinated officials.However, scientists have since noted flaws in the study's experimental design. For example, the number of vaccinated individuals studied was more than twice as large as the number of those who were not vaccinated. In addition, the study tested for an unspecified ""coronavirus,"" not SARS-CoV-2.Nowhere in the study does it say flu vaccines increase the chance of contracting the coronavirus by 36 per cent.Influenza and COVID-19 come from two different families of viruses and have no cross-effect, according to infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch.Bogoch told CTV's Your Morning in March that a regular flu shot will not protect nor increase one's risk against COVID-19. However, he said individuals can ""optimize"" the immune system by getting vaccinated for everything that they are eligible to be vaccinated for, such as influenza or bacterial pneumonias.
While it is still unclear if someone can contract COVID-19 more than once, it is possible to have more than one different virus at the same time, such as the new coronavirus and a strain of the flu.OPPOSITION TO CDC GUIDELINES.In 'Plandemic', a number of unidentified individuals described only as doctors are seen questioning the guidelines put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on physical distancing, or suggesting the preventative measures have been issued for profit.Mikovits alleges that doctors and hospitals have been ""incentivized"" to count deaths unrelated to COVID-19 as having been caused by the virus to get greater payouts from the American federal health insurance program Medicare. Medicare pays hospitals a set amount of money for the treatment of certain diagnoses, regardless of what the treatment actually costs.Medicare has determined that a hospital gets US$13,000 if a COVID-19 patient on Medicare is admitted, and $39,000 if the patient goes on a ventilator. The CARES Act -- one of three federal stimulus laws enacted in the U.S. in response to the pandemic -- has included an add-on of 20 per cent that Medicare will pay hospitals for COVID-19 patients in a move to help with their lost revenue from the halting of elective surgeries. However, Congress has included strict policies for reporting this.While the U.S. government is giving more money to hospitals that treat coronavirus patients, there is no proof that hospitals are over-identifying patients as having COVID-19.ACCUSATIONS AGAINST FAUCI.Many of Mikovits' claims concern various high-profile individuals who have become more prominent amid the pandemic. Most notable is Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984 and one of the lead members of the Trump administration's White House Coronavirus Task Force.While Mikovits repeatedly drops Fauci's name, she never actually connects him in any material way to her theory that this pandemic was planned.Mikovits alleges that Fauci orchestrated a cover-up, but of what is unclear. She says that people were ""paid off big time,"" suggesting Fauci may have engaged in some sort of improper activity. However, Mikovits later clarifies that she means researchers' labs got funding from NIAID, which is how science research is typically funded in the U.S.In an article originally published in December 2018, fact-checking website Snopes reported on a claim by Mikovits that Fauci sent an email that ""threatened her with arrest if she visited the National Institutes of Health to participate in a study to validate her chronic fatigue research.""Fauci told Snopes he had ""no idea what she was talking about.""""I can categorically state that I have never sent such an e-mail,"" Fauci said. ""I would never make such a statement in an e-mail that anyone 'would be immediately arrested' if they stepped foot on NIH property.""Mikovits also said Fauci profited from patents from research done at NIAID.The Associated Press reported in 2005 that scientists at NIAID ""have collected millions of dollars in royalties for experimental treatments without having to tell patients testing the treatments that the researchers' had a financial connection.""Fauci later told peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ that as a government employee, he was required by law to put his name on certain patents. However, he said he felt it was inappropriate to receive payment and donated the money to charity.MIKOVITS' BACKGROUND.Presented in the video as a medical expert, Judy Mikovits is one of 13 researchers who, in 2009, claimed to have found a link between a mouse retrovirus and chronic fatigue syndrome -- a disorder with no proven explanation and no cure. The findings were published in prestigious peer-reviewed journal Science.
In the video, filmmaker Willis says the paper ""sent shockwaves through the scientific community, as it revealed the common use of animal and human fetal tissues were unleashing devastating plagues of chronic diseases.""However, the paper was retracted two years after its publication. Science said at the time that ""multiple laboratories, including those of the original authors, have failed to reliably detect"" the mouse retrovirus in chronic fatigue syndrome patients. The journal also cited ""evidence of poor quality control in a number of specific experiments"" in the report.Mikovits has not published anything in scientific literature since 2012, but she has co-authored two bestselling books with Kent Heckenlively, a noted anti-vaxxer.According to the Chicago Tribune, Whittemore Peterson Institute at the University of Nevada fired Mikovits in September 2011 from her job as research director at the facility after her study was retracted. In November 2011, a criminal complaint was filed against Mikovits for allegedly stealing computer data, notebooks and other property from the institute.Mikovits says in 'Plandemic' that the notebooks were ""planted"" in her house and that she was ""held in jail with no charges."" As she is speaking, footage of what appears to be a police SWAT team executing a nighttime raid is shown.The Chicago Tribune said Mikovits was arrested in California as a fugitive on a warrant issued by Reno police in relation to the November 2011 complaint. She was held in a California jail for five days before being released after an arraignment hearing.The criminal charges were later dropped, although the Whittemore Peterson Institute subsequently won a default judgment in a civil suit against her seeking the return of the items. A colleague at the institute admitted in an affidavit for the criminal case that he had taken items from the lab on behalf of Mikovits.
A typical viewer of 'Plandemic' may not know these details about Mikovits' background. Mikovits did not respond to CTVNews.ca's request for comment.
Jonathan Jarry, a biologist and science communication expert at McGill University, said it is also the way that Mikovits speaks that can make her seem convincing.
""Her tone is just right. She sounds cool-headed. She is portraying herself as a victim of a cruel system so we can empathize with her,"" Jarry said in an email to CTVNews.ca on Monday. He added that Mikovits uses a Gish gallop, a common debating technique in which the speaker runs through a long list of arguments that appear convincing just by their sheer number and ""would take four times as long to refute.""Jarry says the video's documentary-like style also plays a role in making its misleading conspiracy theories seem legitimate.""With a little bit of money, anyone can now produce a serious-looking documentary. These images look professional, so they are more convincing to us,"" Jarry said. ""The video also taps into our collective anxiety during this pandemic, of looking for someone to blame, some clear answer to the questions we are asking.""",1
"The rapid spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 has sparked alarm worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, and countries around the world are grappling with a surge in confirmed cases. In the US, social distancing to slow the spread of coronavirus has created a new normal. Meanwhile, scientists are exploring potential treatments and are beginning clinical trials to test new therapies and vaccines. And hospitals are ramping up their capabilities to care for increasing numbers of infected patients.",1
"The following actions help prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses and influenza: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick.Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces every day. High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.Wash your hands often with soap and water.This chart illustrates how protective measures such as limiting travel, avoiding crowds, social distancing, and thorough and frequent handwashing can slow down the development of new COVID-19 cases and reduce the risk of overwhelming the health care system.",1
"Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; and after handling anything that's come from outside your home. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.The CDC's handwashing website has detailed instructions and a video about effective handwashing procedures.",1
"The coronavirus is thought to spread mainly from person to person. This can happen between people who are in close contact with one another. Droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes may land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs.A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air for up to three hours. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the coronavirus. This is why everyone should cover their nose and mouth when they go out in public.Coronavirus can also spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects. For example, a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.The virus may be shed in saliva, semen, and feces; whether it is shed in vaginal fluids isn't known. Kissing can transmit the virus. Transmission of the virus through feces, or during vaginal or anal intercourse or oral sex, appears to be extremely unlikely at this time.",1
"Anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has COVID-19 is at increased risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially infecting others. Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious. In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms.The contacts are notified about their exposure. They may be told what symptoms to look out for, advised to isolate themselves for a period of time, and to seek medical attention as needed if they start to experience symptoms.",1
"The COVID-19 virus primarily spreads when one person breathes in droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In addition, any infected person, with or without symptoms, could spread the virus by touching a surface. The coronavirus could remain on that surface and someone else could touch it and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. That's why it's so important to try to avoid touching public surfaces or at least try to wipe them with a disinfectant.Social distancing refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance (6 feet or more) between yourself and another person to avoid getting infected or infecting someone else. School closures, directives to work from home, library closings, and cancelling meetings and larger events help enforce social distancing at a community level.Slowing down the rate and number of new coronavirus infections is critical to reduce the risk that large numbers of critically ill patients cannot receive life-saving care. Highly realistic projections show that unless we begin extreme social distancing now — every day matters — our hospitals and other healthcare facilities will not be able to handle the likely influx of patients.",1
"Try to stock at least a 30-day supply of any needed prescriptions. If your insurance permits 90-day refills, that's even better. Make sure you also have over-the-counter medications and other health supplies on hand.Medical and health supplies, prescription medications, prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood-pressure monitoring equipment, fever and pain medicine, such as acetaminophen, cough and cold medicines, antidiarrheal medication, thermometer, fluids with electrolytes, soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer, tissues, toilet paper, disposable diapers, tampons, sanitary napkins, garbage bags.",1
"Consider keeping a two-week to 30-day supply of nonperishable food at home. These items can also come in handy in other types of emergencies, such as power outages or snowstorms.canned meats, fruits, vegetables, and soups, frozen fruits, vegetables, and meat, protein or fruit bars, dry cereal, oatmeal, or granola, peanut butter or nuts, pasta, bread, rice, and other grains, canned beans, chicken broth, canned tomatoes, jarred pasta sauce, oil for cooking, flour, sugar, crackers, coffee, tea, shelf-stable milk, canned juices, bottled water, canned or jarred baby food and formula, pet food, household supplies like laundry detergent, dish soap, and household cleaner.",1
"The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through droplets containing virus, or through viral particles that float in the air. The virus may be breathed in directly and can also spread when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes. There is no current evidence that the COVID-19 virus is transmitted through food.Safety precautions help you avoid breathing in coronavirus or touching a contaminated surface and touching your face.In the grocery store, maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and other shoppers. Wipe frequently touched surfaces like grocery carts or basket handles with disinfectant wipes. Avoid touching your face. Wearing a cloth mask helps remind you not to touch your face and can further help reduce spread of the virus. Use hand sanitizer before leaving the store. Wash your hands as soon as you get home.If you are older than 65 or at increased risk for any reason, limit trips to the grocery store. Ask a neighbor or friend to pick up groceries and leave them outside your house. See if your grocery store offers special hours for older adults or those with underlying conditions. Or have groceries delivered to your home.",1
"Recent studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus may remain on surfaces or objects for up to 72 hours. This means virus on the surface of groceries will become inactivated over time after groceries are put away. If you need to use the products before 72 hours, consider washing the outside surfaces or wiping them with disinfectant. The contents of sealed containers won't be contaminated.After unpacking your groceries, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Wipe surfaces on which you placed groceries while unpacking them with household disinfectants.Thoroughly rinse fruits and vegetables with water before consuming. And wash your hands before consuming any foods that you've recently brought home from the grocery store.",1
"The answer to all of the above is that it is critical that everyone begin intensive social distancing immediately. As much as possible, limit contact with people outside your family.If you need to get food, staples, medications or healthcare, try to stay at least six feet away from others, and wash your hands thoroughly after the trip, avoiding contact with your face and mouth throughout. Prepare your own food as much as possible. If you do order takeout, open the bag, box or containers, then wash your hands. Lift, fork or spoon out the contents into your own dishes. After you dispose of these outside containers, wash your hands again. Most restaurants, gyms and public pools are closed; but even if one is open, now is not the time to go.Here are some other things to avoid: playdates, parties, sleepovers, having friends or family over for meals or visits, and going to coffee shops — essentially any nonessential activity that involves close contact with others.",1
"Try to look at this period of social distancing as an opportunity to get to things you've been meaning to do.Though you shouldn't go to the gym right now, that doesn't mean you can't exercise. Take long walks or run outside (do your best to maintain at least six feet between you and non-family members when you're outside). Do some yoga or other indoor exercise routines when the weather isn't cooperating.Kids need exercise too, so try to get them outside every day for walks or a backyard family soccer game (remember, this isn't the time to invite the neighborhood kids over to play). Avoid public playground structures, which aren't cleaned regularly and can spread the virus.Pull out board games that are gathering dust on your shelves. Have family movie nights. Catch up on books you've been meaning to read, or do a family read-aloud every evening.It's important to stay connected even though we should not do so in person. Keep in touch virtually through phone calls, Skype, video, and other social media. Enjoy a leisurely chat with an old friend you've been meaning to call.If all else fails, go to bed early and get some extra sleep!",1
"The CDC now recommends that everyone in the US wear nonsurgical masks when going out in public.Coronavirus primarily spreads when someone breathes in droplets containing virus that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes or when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. But people who are infected but do not have symptoms, or have not yet developed symptoms, can also infect others. That's where masks come in.A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the virus. A mask can help prevent that spread. An article published in NEJM in March reported that aerosolized coronavirus could remain in the air for up to three hours.What kind of mask should you wear? Because of the short supply, people without symptoms or without exposure to someone known to be infected with the coronavirus can wear a cloth face covering over their nose and mouth. They do help prevent others from becoming infected if you happen to be carrying the virus unknowingly.While N95 masks are the most effective, these medical-grade masks are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers.Some parts of the US also have inadequate supplies of surgical masks. If you have a surgical mask, you may need to reuse it at this time. But never share your mask.Surgical masks are preferred if you are caring for someone who has COVID-19 or you have any respiratory symptoms (even mild symptoms) and must go out in public.Masks are more effective when they are tight-fitting and cover your entire nose and mouth. They can help discourage you from touching your face (be sure you're not touching your face more often to adjust the mask). Masks are meant to be used in addition to, not instead of, physical distancing.The CDC has information on how to make, wear, and clean nonsurgical masks.The WHO offers videos and illustrations on when and how to use a mask.",1
"Stay current on travel advisories from regulatory agencies. This is a rapidly changing situation.Anyone who has a fever and respiratory symptoms should not fly if at all possible. Even if a person has symptoms that feel like just a cold, he or she should wear a mask on an airplane.",1
"No vaccine is available, although scientists will be starting human testing on a vaccine very soon. However, it may be a year or more before we even know if we have a vaccine that works.",1
"While we don't know the answer yet, most people would likely develop at least short-term immunity to the specific coronavirus that causes COVID-19. However, that immunity could diminish over time and you would still be susceptible to a different coronavirus infection. Or, this particular virus could mutate, just like the influenza virus does each year. Often these mutations change the virus enough to make you susceptible, because your immune system thinks it is an infection that it has never seen before.",1
"Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections. They do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia, including pneumonia that may be part of COVID-19. However, even though these vaccines do not specifically protect against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, they are highly recommended to protect against other respiratory illnesses.",1
"People who are older and older people with chronic medical conditions, especially cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and lung disease are more likely to have severe disease or death from COVID-19, and should engage in strict social distancing without delay. This is also the case for people or who are immunocompromised because of a condition or treatment that weakens their immune response.The decision to provide on-site help with your children and grandchildren is a difficult one. If there is an alternative to support their needs without being there, that would be safest.",1
"At present, there is no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can spread the COVID-19 virus to humans. However, pets can spread other infections that cause illness, including E. coli and Salmonella, so wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after interacting with pets.",1
"Your immune system is your body's defense system. When a harmful invader — like a cold or flu virus, or the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — gets into your body, your immune system mounts an attack. Known as an immune response, this attack is a sequence of events that involves various cells and unfolds over time.
Following general health guidelines is the best step you can take toward keeping your immune system strong and healthy. Every part of your body, including your immune system, functions better when protected from environmental assaults and bolstered by healthy-living strategies such as these:Don't smoke or vape.Eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.Take a multivitamin if you suspect that you may not be getting all the nutrients you need through your diet.
Exercise regularly.Maintain a healthy weight.Control your stress level.Control your blood pressure.If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation (no more than one to two drinks a day for men, no more than one a day for women).Get enough sleep.Take steps to avoid infection, such as washing your hands frequently and trying not to touch your hands to your face, since harmful germs can enter through your eyes, nose, and mouth.",1
"During this period of social distancing, it is best to postpone nonurgent appointments with your doctor or dentist. These may include regular well visits or dental cleanings, as well as follow-up appointments to manage chronic conditions if your health has been relatively stable in the recent past. You should also postpone routine screening tests, such as a mammogram or PSA blood test, if you are at average risk of disease. Many doctor's offices have started restricting office visits to urgent matters only, so you may not have a choice in the matter.As an alternative, doctor's offices are increasingly providing telehealth services. This may mean appointments by phone call, or virtual visits using a video chat service. Ask to schedule a telehealth appointment with your doctor for a new or ongoing nonurgent matter. If, after speaking to you, your doctor would like to see you in person, he or she will let you know.What if your appointments are not urgent but also don't fall into the low-risk category? For example, if you have been advised to have periodic scans after cancer remission, if your doctor sees you regularly to monitor for a condition for which you're at increased risk, or if your treatment varies based on your most recent test results? In these and similar cases, call your doctor for advice.",1
"It's likely that your elective surgery or procedure will be canceled or rescheduled by the hospital or medical center in which you are scheduled to have the procedure. If not, then during this period of social distancing, you should consider postponing any procedure that can wait.That being said, keep in mind that ""elective"" is a relative term. For instance, you may not have needed immediate surgery for sciatica caused by a herniated disc. But the pain may be so severe that you would not be able to endure postponing the surgery for weeks or perhaps months. In that case, you and your doctor should make a shared decision about proceeding.",1
Coronaviruses are an extremely common cause of colds and other upper respiratory infections.,1
"COVID-19, short for ""coronavirus disease 2019,"" is the official name given by the World Health Organization to the disease caused by this newly identified coronavirus.",1
"The numbers are changing rapidly.The most up-to-date information is available from the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Johns Hopkins University.It has spread so rapidly and to so many countries that the World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic (a term indicating that it has affected a large population, region, country, or continent).",1
"Yes, they do. Though people younger than 65 are much less likely to die from COVID-19, they can get sick enough from the disease to require hospitalization. According to a report published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) in late March, nearly 40% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 between mid-February and mid-March were between the ages of 20 and 54. Drilling further down by age, MMWR reported that 20% of hospitalized patients and 12% of COVID-19 patients in ICUs were between the ages of 20 and 44.People of any age should take preventive health measures like frequent hand washing, physical distancing, and wearing a mask when going out in public, to help protect themselves and to reduce the chances of spreading the infection to others.",1
"Some people infected with the virus have no symptoms. When the virus does cause symptoms, common ones include fever, body ache, dry cough, fatigue, chills, headache, sore throat, loss of appetite, and loss of smell. In some people, COVID-19 causes more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia.People with COVID-19 are also experiencing neurological symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, or both. These may occur with or without respiratory symptoms.For example, COVID-19 affects brain function in some people. Specific neurological symptoms seen in people with COVID-19 include loss of smell, inability to taste, muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures, and stroke.In addition, some people have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort associated with COVID-19. These symptoms might start before other symptoms such as fever, body ache, and cough. The virus that causes COVID-19 has also been detected in stool, which reinforces the importance of hand washing after every visit to the bathroom and regularly disinfecting bathroom fixtures.",1
"Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of smell, and body ache. In some people, COVID-19 causes more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia.A person may have mild symptoms for about one week, then worsen rapidly. Let your doctor know if your symptoms quickly worsen over a short period of time. Also call the doctor right away if you or a loved one with COVID-19 experience any of the following emergency symptoms: trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to arouse the person, or bluish lips or face.",1
"A cytokine storm is an overreaction of the body's immune system. In some people with COVID-19, the immune system releases immune messengers, called cytokines, into the bloodstream out of proportion to the threat or long after the virus is no longer a threat.When this happens, the immune system attacks the body's own tissues, potentially causing significant harm. A cytokine storm triggers an exaggerated inflammatory response that may damage the liver, blood vessels, kidneys, and lungs, and increase formation of blood clots throughout the body. Ultimately, the cytokine storm may cause more harm than the coronavirus itself.A simple blood test can help determine whether someone with COVID-19 may be experiencing a cytokine storm. Trials in countries around the world are investigating whether drugs that have been used to treat cytokine storms in people with other, non-COVID conditions could be effective in people with COVID-19.",1
"Shortness of breath refers to unexpectedly feeling out of breath, or winded. But when should you worry about shortness of breath? There are many examples of temporary shortness of breath that are not worrisome. For example, if you feel very anxious, it's common to get short of breath and then it goes away when you calm down.However, if you find that you are ever breathing harder or having trouble getting air each time you exert yourself, you always need to call your doctor. That was true before we had the recent outbreak of COVID-19, and it will still be true after it is over.Meanwhile, it's important to remember that if shortness of breath is your only symptom, without a cough or fever, something other than COVID-19 is the likely problem.",1
"Strokes occur when the brain's blood supply is interrupted, usually by a blood clot. Recently, there have been reports of a greater-than-expected number of younger patients being hospitalized for, and sometimes dying from, serious strokes. These strokes are happening in patients who test positive for coronavirus but who do not have any traditional risk factors for stroke. They tend to have no COVID-19 symptoms, or only mild symptoms. The type of stroke occurring in these patients typically occurs in much older patients.COVID-related strokes occur because of a bodywide increase in blood clot formation, which can damage any organ, not just the brain. A blood clot in the lungs is called pulmonary embolism and can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, or death; a blood clot in or near the heart can cause a heart attack; and blood clots in the kidneys can cause kidney damage requiring dialysis.We don't yet know if the coronavirus itself stimulates blood clots to form, or if they are a result of an overactive immune response to the virus.",1
"COVID-19 does appear to affect brain function in some people. Specific neurological symptoms seen in people with COVID-19 include loss of smell, inability to taste, muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures, and stroke.One study that looked at 214 people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in Wuhan, China found that about one-third of those patients had one or more neurological symptoms. Neurological symptoms were more common in people with more severe disease.Neurological symptoms have also been seen in COVID-19 patients in the US and around the world. Some people with neurological symptoms tested positive for COVID-19 but did not have any respiratory symptoms like coughing or difficulty breathing; others experienced both neurological and respiratory symptoms.Experts do not know how the coronavirus causes neurological symptoms. They may be a direct result of infection or an indirect consequence of inflammation or altered oxygen and carbon dioxide levels caused by the virus.The CDC has added ""new confusion or inability to rouse"" to its list of emergency warning signs that should prompt you to get immediate medical attention.",1
"Increasing evidence suggests that a lost sense of smell, known medically as anosmia, may be a symptom of COVID-19. This is not surprising, because viral infections are a leading cause of loss of sense of smell, and COVID-19 is a caused by a virus. Still, loss of smell might help doctors identify people who do not have other symptoms, but who might be infected with the COVID-19 virus — and who might be unwittingly infecting others.A statement written by a group of ear, nose and throat specialists (otolaryngologists) in the United Kingdom reported that in Germany, two out of three confirmed COVID-19 cases had a loss of sense of smell; in South Korea, 30% of people with mild symptoms who tested positive for COVID-19 reported anosmia as their main symptom.On March 22nd, the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery recommended that anosmia be added to the list of COVID-19 symptoms used to screen people for possible testing or self-isolation.In addition to COVID-19, loss of smell can also result from allergies as well as other viruses, including rhinoviruses that cause the common cold. So anosmia alone does not mean you have COVID-19. Studies are being done to get more definitive answers about how common anosmia is in people with COVID-19, at what point after infection loss of smell occurs, and how to distinguish loss of smell caused by COVID-19 from loss of smell caused by allergies, other viruses, or other causes altogether.Until we know more, tell your doctor right away if you find yourself newly unable to smell. He or she may prompt you to get tested and to self-isolate.",1
"Recently published research found that on average, the time from exposure to symptom onset (known as the incubation period) is about five to six days. However, studies have shown that symptoms could appear as soon as three days after exposure to as long as 13 days later. These findings continue to support the CDC recommendation of self-quarantine and monitoring of symptoms for 14 days post exposure.",1
"The coronavirus is thought to spread mainly from person to person. This can happen between people who are in close contact with one another. Droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes may land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs.
A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air for up to three hours. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the coronavirus. This is why everyone should cover their nose and mouth when they go out in public.Coronavirus can also spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects. For example, a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.The virus may be shed in saliva, semen, and feces; whether it is shed in vaginal fluids isn't known. Kissing can transmit the virus. Transmission of the virus through feces, or during vaginal or anal intercourse or oral sex, appears to be extremely unlikely at this time.",1
"Anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has COVID-19 is at increased risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially infecting others. Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious. In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms.The contacts are notified about their exposure. They may be told what symptoms to look out for, advised to isolate themselves for a period of time, and to seek medical attention as needed if they start to experience symptoms.",1
"The answer depends on whether you're looking at the fatality rate (the risk of death among those who are infected) or the total number of deaths. So far, influenza has caused far more total deaths this flu season, both in the US and worldwide, than COVID-19. This is why you may have heard it said that the flu is a bigger threat.Regarding the fatality rate, it appears that the risk of death with the pandemic coronavirus infection (commonly estimated at about 1%) is far less than it was for SARS (approximately 11%) and MERS (about 35%), but will likely be higher than the risk from seasonal flu (which averages about 0.1%). We will have a more accurate estimate of fatality rate for this coronavirus infection once testing becomes more available.What we do know so far is the risk of death very much depends on your age and your overall health. Children appear to be at very low risk of severe disease and death. Older adults and those who smoke or have chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or lung disease have a higher chance of developing complications like pneumonia, which could be deadly.",1
"Some viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more when the weather is colder. But it is still possible to become sick with these viruses during warmer months.At this time, we do not know for certain whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather warms up. But a new report suggests that warmer weather may not have much of an impact.The report, published in early April by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, summarized research that looked at how well the COVID-19 coronavirus survives in varying temperatures and humidity levels, and whether the spread of this coronavirus may slow in warmer and more humid weather.The report found that in laboratory settings, higher temperatures and higher levels of humidity decreased survival of the COVID-19 coronavirus. However, studies looking at viral spread in varying climate conditions in the natural environment had inconsistent results.The researchers concluded that conditions of increased heat and humidity alone may not significantly slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus.",1
"A study done by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' Laboratory of Virology in the Division of Intramural Research in Hamilton, Montana helps to answer this question. The researchers used a nebulizer to blow coronaviruses into the air. They found that infectious viruses could remain in the air for up to three hours. The results of the study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17, 2020.",1
"A recent study found that the COVID-19 coronavirus can survive up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers also found that this virus can hang out as droplets in the air for up to three hours before they fall. But most often they will fall more quickly.There's a lot we still don't know, such as how different conditions, such as exposure to sunlight, heat, or cold, can affect these survival times.As we learn more, continue to follow the CDC's recommendations for cleaning frequently touched surfaces and objects every day. These include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.If surfaces are dirty, first clean them using a detergent and water, then disinfect them. A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.In addition, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water after bringing in packages, or after trips to the grocery store or other places where you may have come into contact with infected surfaces.",1
"We are still learning about transmission of the new coronavirus. It's not clear if it can be spread by an infected person through food they have handled or prepared, but if so it would more likely be the exception than the rule.That said, the new coronavirus is a respiratory virus known to spread by upper respiratory secretions, including airborne droplets after coughing or sneezing. The virus that causes COVID-19 has also been detected in the stool of certain people. So we currently cannot rule out the possibility of the infection being transmitted through food by an infected person who has not thoroughly washed their hands. In the case of hot food, the virus would likely be killed by cooking. This may not be the case with uncooked foods like salads or sandwiches.",1
"You're right to be concerned about the flu. Fortunately, the same measures that help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus — frequent and thorough handwashing, not touching your face, coughing and sneezing into a tissue or your elbow, avoiding people who are sick, and staying away from people if you're sick — also help to protect against spread of the flu.If you do get sick with the flu, your doctor can prescribe an antiviral drug that can reduce the severity of your illness and shorten its duration. There are currently no antiviral drugs available to treat COVID-19.",1
"While the flu shot won't protect you from developing COVID-19, it's still a good idea. Most people older than six months can and should get the flu vaccine. Doing so reduces the chances of getting seasonal flu. Even if the vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting the flu, it can decrease the chance of severe symptoms. But again, the flu vaccine will not protect you against this coronavirus.",1
"Older people, especially those with underlying medical problems like chronic bronchitis, emphysema, heart failure, or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.In addition, several underlying medical conditions may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age. These include:blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease, or taking blood thinners. chronic kidney disease. chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis. any condition or treatment that weakens the immune response (cancer, cancer treatment, organ or bone marrow transplant, immunosuppressant medications, HIV or AIDS), current or recent pregnancy in the last two weeks.diabetes, inherited metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders heart disease, including coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, and heart failure lung disease, including asthma, COPD (chronic bronchitis or emphysema). neurological and neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy (seizure disorders), stroke, intellectual disability, moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury.",1
"Anyone 60 years or older is considered to be at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19. This is true whether or not you also have an underlying medical condition, although the sickest individuals and most of the deaths have been among people who were both older and had chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung problems or diabetes.The CDC suggests the following measures for those who are at higher risk:Obtain several weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time.Take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others.When you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact, and wash your hands often.Avoid crowds.Avoid cruise travel and nonessential air travel.During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed.",1
"You can take steps to lower your risk of getting infected in the first place:As much as possible, limit contact with people outside your family.Maintain enough distance (six feet or more) between yourself and anyone outside your family.Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 to 30 seconds.As best you can, avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.Stay away from people who are sick.During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed.Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces in your home, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day.In addition, do your best to keep your condition well-controlled. That means following your doctor's recommendations including taking medications as directed. If possible, get a 90-day supply of your prescription medications and request that they be mailed to you so you don't have to go to the pharmacy to pick them up.Call your doctor for additional advice specific to your condition.",1
"Yes, asthma may increase your risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. However, you can take steps to lower your risk of getting infected in the first place. These include. social distancing. washing your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 to 30 seconds. not touching your eyes, nose or mouth. staying away from people who are sick.In addition, you should continue to take your asthma medicines as prescribed to keep your asthma under control. If you do get sick, follow your asthma action plan and call your doctor.",1
"If you contract the virus, your response to it will depend on many factors, only one of which is taking medication that suppresses your immune system. In addition, stopping the medication on your own could cause your underlying condition to get worse. Most importantly, don't make this decision on your own. It's always best not to adjust the dose or stop taking a prescription medication without first talking to the doctor who prescribed the medication.",1
"You are referring to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), two types of medications used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart disease. Doctors also prescribe these medicines for people who have protein in their urine, a common problem in people with diabetes.At this time, the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) strongly recommend that people taking these medications should continue to do so, even if they become infected.Here's how this concern got started. Researchers doing animal studies on a different coronavirus (the SARS coronavirus from the early 2000s) found that certain sites on lung cells called ACE-2 receptors appeared to help the SARS virus enter the lungs and cause pneumonia. ACE inhibitor and ARB drugs raised ACE-2 receptor levels in the animals.Could this mean people taking these drugs are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and are more likely to get pneumonia?The reality today:Human studies have not confirmed the findings in animal studies.Some studies suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may reduce lung injury in people with other viral pneumonias. The same might be true of pneumonia caused by the COVID-19 virus.Stopping your ACE inhibitor or ARB could actually put you at greater risk of complications from the infection, since it's likely that your blood pressure will rise and heart problems would get worse.The bottom line: The AHA, ACC, and HFSA strongly recommend continuing to take ACE inhibitor or ARB medications, even if you get sick with COVID-19.",1
"In a situation where there is no choice — such as if the grandparent lives with the grandchildren — then the family should do everything they can to try to limit the risk of COVID-19. The grandchildren should be isolated as much as possible, as should the parents, so that the overall family risk is as low as possible. Everyone should wash their hands very frequently throughout the day, and surfaces should be wiped clean frequently. Physical contact should be limited to the absolutely necessary; as wonderful as it can be to snuggle with Grandma or Grandpa, now is not the time.",1
"Some people infected with the virus have no symptoms. When the virus does cause symptoms, common ones include fever, body ache, dry cough, fatigue, chills, headache, sore throat, loss of appetite, and loss of smell. In some people, COVID-19 causes more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia.People with COVID-19 are also experiencing neurological symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, or both. These may occur with or without respiratory symptoms.For example, COVID-19 affects brain function in some people. Specific neurological symptoms seen in people with COVID-19 include loss of smell, inability to taste, muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures, and stroke.In addition, some people have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort associated with COVID-19. These symptoms might start before other symptoms such as fever, body ache, and cough. The virus that causes COVID-19 has also been detected in stool, which reinforces the importance of hand washing after every visit to the bathroom and regularly disinfecting bathroom fixtures.",1
"First call your doctor or pediatrician for advice.If you do not have a doctor and you are concerned that you or your child may have COVID-19, contact your local board of health. They can direct you to the best place for evaluation and treatment in your area.It's best to not seek medical care in an emergency department unless you have symptoms of severe illness. Severe symptoms include high or very low body temperature, shortness of breath, confusion, or feeling you might pass out. Call the emergency department ahead of time to let the staff know that you are coming, so they can be prepared for your arrival.",1
"COVID-19 often causes symptoms similar to those a person with a bad cold or the flu would experience. And like the flu, the symptoms can progress and become life-threatening. Your doctor is more likely to suspect coronavirus if:you have respiratory symptoms and you have been exposed to someone suspected of having COVID-19, or there has been community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in your area.",1
"A specialized test must be done to confirm that a person has been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Most often a clinician takes a swab of your nose (or both your nose and throat). New methods of testing that can be done on site will become more available over the next few weeks. These new tests can provide results in as little as 15–45 minutes. Meanwhile, most tests will still be delivered to labs that have been approved to perform the test.Some people are starting to have a blood test to look for antibodies to the COVID-19 virus. Because the blood test for antibodies doesn't become positive until after an infected person improves, it is not useful as a diagnostic test at this time. Scientists are using this blood antibody test to identify potential plasma donors. The antibodies can be purified from the plasma and may help some very sick people get better.",1
"Until recently, most tests for COVID-19 required a clinician to insert a long swab into the nose and sometimes down to the throat. In mid-April, the FDA granted emergency approval for a saliva-based test.The saliva test is easier to perform — spitting into a cup versus submitting to a swab — and more comfortable. Because a person can independently spit into a cup, the saliva test does not require interaction with a healthcare worker. This cuts down on the need for masks, gowns, gloves, and other protective equipment, which has been in short supply.Both the saliva and swab tests work by detecting genetic material from the coronavirus. Both tests are very specific, meaning that a positive test almost always means that the person is infected with the virus. However, both tests can be negative, even if a person is proven later to be infected (known as a 0 negative). This is especially true for people who carry the virus but have no symptoms.Some early reports suggest that the saliva test may have fewer 0 negatives than the swab test. If verified, home testing could potentially quickly ramp up the widespread testing we desperately need.",1
"In the US, the most common test for the COVID-19 virus looks for viral RNA in a sample taken with a swab from a person's nose or throat. Tests results may come back in as little as 15–45 minutes for some of the newer on-site tests; with other tests you may wait three to four days for results.If a test result comes back positive, it is almost certain that the person is infected.A negative test result is less definite. An infected person could get a so-called ""0 negative"" test result if the swab missed the virus, for example, or because of an inadequacy of the test itself. We also don't yet know at what point during the course of illness a test becomes positive.If you experience COVID-like symptoms and get a negative test result, there is no reason to repeat the test unless your symptoms get worse. If your symptoms do worsen, call your doctor or local or state healthcare department for guidance on further testing. You should also self-isolate at home. Wear a mask if you have one when interacting with members of your household. And practice social distancing.",1
"A serologic test is a blood test that looks for antibodies created by your immune system. There are many reasons you might make antibodies, the most important of which is to help fight infections. The serologic test for COVID-19 specifically looks for antibodies against the COVID-19 virus.Your body takes at least five to 10 days after you have acquired the infection to develop antibodies to this virus. For this reason, serologic tests are not sensitive enough to accurately diagnose an active COVID-19 infection, even in people with symptoms.However, serologic tests can help identify anyone who has recovered from coronavirus. This may include people who were not initially identified as having COVID-19 because they had no symptoms, had mild symptoms, chose not to get tested, had a 0-negative test, or could not get tested for any reason. Serologic tests will provide a more accurate picture of how many people have been infected with, and recovered from, coronavirus, as well as the true fatality rate.Serologic tests may also provide information about whether people become immune to coronavirus once they've recovered and, if so, how long that immunity lasts. In time, these tests may be used to determine who can safely go back out into the community.Scientists can also study coronavirus antibodies to learn which parts of the coronavirus the immune system responds to, in turn giving them clues about which part of the virus to target in vaccines they are developing.Serological tests are starting to become available and are being developed by many private companies worldwide. However, the accuracy of these tests needs to be validated before widespread use in the US.",1
"The time from exposure to symptom onset (known as the incubation period) is thought to be three to 14 days, though symptoms typically appear within four or five days after exposure.We know that a person with COVID-19 may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before starting to experience symptoms. Emerging research suggests that people may actually be most likely to spread the virus to others during the 48 hours before they start to experience symptoms.If true, this strengthens the case for face masks, physical distancing, and contact tracing, all of which can help reduce the risk that someone who is infected but not yet contagious may unknowingly infect others.",1
"People are thought to be most contagious early in the course of their illness, when they are beginning to experience symptoms, especially if they are coughing and sneezing. But people with no symptoms can also spread the coronavirus to other people if they stand too close to them. In fact, people who are infected may be more likely to spread the illness if they are asymptomatic, or in the days before they develop symptoms, because they are less likely to be isolating or adopting behaviors designed to prevent spread.Most people with coronavirus who have symptoms will no longer be contagious by 10 days after symptoms resolve. People who test positive for the virus but never develop symptoms over the following 10 days after testing are probably no longer contagious, but again there are documented exceptions. So some experts are still recommending 14 days of isolation.One of the main problems with general rules regarding contagion and transmission of this coronavirus is the marked differences in how it behaves in different individuals. That's why everyone needs to wear a mask and keep a physical distance of at least six feet.Here is a more ""scientific"" way to determine if you are no longer contagious: have two nasal-throat tests or saliva tests 24 hours apart that are both negative for the virus.",1
"It depends on how sick you get. Those with mild cases appear to recover within one to two weeks. With severe cases, recovery can take six weeks or more. According to the most recent estimates, about 1% of infected persons will succumb to the disease.",1
"We don't know for certain. Based on the most recent research, people may continue to be infected with the virus and be potentially contagious for many days after they are feeling better. But these results need to be verified. Until then, even after 10 days of complete resolution of your symptoms, you should still take all precautions if you do need to go out in public, including wearing a mask, minimizing touching surfaces, and keeping at least six feet of distance away from other people.",1
"Self-isolation is voluntary isolation at home by those who have or are likely to have COVID-19 and are experiencing mild symptoms of the disease (in contrast to those who are severely ill and may be isolated in a hospital). The purpose of self-isolation is to prevent spread of infection from an infected person to others who are not infected. If possible, the decision to isolate should be based on physician recommendation. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you should self-isolate.You should strongly consider self-isolation if you. have been tested for COVID-19 and are awaiting test results. have been exposed to the new coronavirus and are experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing), whether or not you have been tested.You may also consider self-isolation if you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing) but have not had known exposure to the new coronavirus and have not been tested for the virus that causes COVID-19. In this case, it may be reasonable to isolate yourself until your symptoms fully resolve, or until you are able to be tested for COVID-19 and your test comes back negative.Self-quarantine for 14 days by anyone with a household member who has been infected, whether or not they themselves are infected, is the current recommendation of the White House task force. Otherwise, voluntary quarantine at home by those who may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus but are not experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing). The purpose of self-quarantine (as with self-isolation) is to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. When possible, the decision to quarantine should be based on physician recommendation. Self-quarantine is reasonable if you are not experiencing symptoms, but have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.",1
"If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you may be infected with the COVID-19 virus, it is important not to spread the infection to others while you recover. While home-isolation or home-quarantine may sound like a staycation, you should be prepared for a long period during which you might feel disconnected from others and anxious about your health and the health of your loved ones. Staying in touch with others by phone or online can be helpful to maintain social connections, ask for help, and update others on your condition.Here's what the CDC recommends to minimize the risk of spreading the infection to others in your home and community.Stay home except to get medical care. Do not go to work, school, or public areas.Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.Call ahead before visiting your doctor.Call your doctor and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider's office to take steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home.As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Use a separate bathroom, if available.Restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a face mask.Wear a face mask if you are sick.Wear a face mask when you are around other people or pets and before you enter a doctor's office or hospital.Cover your coughs and sneezes.Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and throw used tissues in a lined trash can.Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after you sneeze. If soap and water are not available, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.Clean your hands often.Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.Don't share personal household items.Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home.After using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water.Clean all ""high-touch"" surfaces every day.High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.Clean and disinfect areas that may have any bodily fluids on them.A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.Monitor your symptoms.Monitor yourself for fever by taking your temperature twice a day and remain alert for cough or difficulty breathing.If you have not had symptoms and you begin to feel feverish or develop measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, immediately limit contact with others if you have not already done so. Call your doctor or local health department to determine whether you need a medical evaluation.
Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening, for example if you have difficulty breathing. Before going to a doctor's office or hospital, call your doctor and tell them that you have, or are being evaluated for, COVID-19.Put on a face mask before you enter a healthcare facility or any time you may come into contact with others.If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you have or are being evaluated for COVID-19. If possible, put on a face mask before emergency medical services arrive.",1
"Try to stock at least a 30-day supply of any needed prescriptions. If your insurance permits 90-day refills, that's even better. Make sure you also have over-the-counter medications and other health supplies on hand.Medical and health supplies.prescription medications. prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood-pressure monitoring equipment. fever and pain medicine, such as acetaminophen. cough and cold medicines. antidiarrheal medication. thermometer. fluids with electrolytes. soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer. tissues, toilet paper, disposable diapers, tampons, sanitary napkins. garbage bags.",1
"Consider keeping a two-week to 30-day supply of nonperishable food at home. These items can also come in handy in other types of emergencies, such as power outages or snowstorms.canned meats, fruits, vegetables, and soups.frozen fruits, vegetables, and meat. protein or fruit bars. dry cereal, oatmeal, or granola. peanut butter or nuts. pasta, bread, rice, and other grains. canned beans. chicken broth, canned tomatoes, jarred pasta sauce. oil for cooking. flour, sugar. crackers. coffee, tea, shelf-stable milk, canned juices. bottled water. canned or jarred baby food and formula. pet food. household supplies like laundry detergent, dish soap, and household cleaner.",1
"While many experts are recommending 14 days of self-quarantine for those who are concerned that they may be infected, the decision to discontinue these measures should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with your doctor and state and local health departments. The decision will be based on the risk of infecting others.",1
"You should take many of the same precautions as you would if you were caring for someone with the flu:Stay in another room or be separated from the person as much as possible. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available.Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow. Turn on an air conditioner or open a window.Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Use soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.Extra precautions:You and the person should wear a face mask if you are in the same room.Wear a disposable face mask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the person's blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.Throw out disposable face masks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.First remove and throw away gloves. Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and throw away the face mask, and immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.Do not share household items such as dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items with the person who is sick. After the person uses these items, wash them thoroughly.Clean all ""high-touch"" surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Use a household cleaning spray or wipe.Wash laundry thoroughly.Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body. Clean your hands immediately after removing your gloves.Place all used disposable gloves, face masks, and other contaminated items in a lined container before disposing of them with other household waste. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these items.",1
"Caring from a distance can be stressful. Start by talking to your parents about what they would need if they were to get sick. Put together a single list of emergency contacts for their (and your) reference, including doctors, family members, neighbors, and friends. Include contact information for their local public health department.You can also help them to plan ahead. For example, ask your parents to give their neighbors or friends a set of house keys. Have them stock up on prescription and over-the counter medications, health and emergency medical supplies, and nonperishable food and household supplies. Check in regularly by phone, Skype, or however you like to stay in touch.",1
"What helps, what doesn't, and what's in the pipeline. Most people who become ill with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. No specific treatments for COVID-19 exist right now. But some of the same things you do to feel better if you have the flu — getting enough rest, staying well hydrated, and taking medications to relieve fever and aches and pains — also help with COVID-19.In the meantime, scientists are working hard to develop effective treatments. Therapies that are under investigation include drugs that have been used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases; antiviral drugs that were developed for other viruses, and antibodies from people who have recovered from COVID-19.",1
"When people recover from COVID-19, their blood contains antibodies that their bodies produced to fight the coronavirus and help them get well. Antibodies are found in plasma, a component of blood.Convalescent plasma — literally plasma from recovered patients — has been used for more than 100 years to treat a variety of illnesses from measles to polio, chickenpox, and SARS. In the current situation, antibody-containing plasma from a recovered patient is given by transfusion to a patient who is suffering from COVID-19. The donor antibodies help the patient fight the illness, possibly shortening the length or reducing the severity of the disease.Though convalescent plasma has been used for many years, and with varying success, not much is known about how effective it is for treating COVID-19. There have been reports of success from China, but no randomized, controlled studies (the gold standard for research studies) have been done. Experts also don't yet know the best time during the course of the illness to give plasma.On March 24th, the FDA began allowing convalescent plasma to be used in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections. This treatment is still considered experimental.",1
"In order to donate plasma, a person must meet several criteria. They have to have tested positive for COVID-19, recovered, have no symptoms for 14 days, currently test negative for COVID-19, and have high enough antibody levels in their plasma. A donor and patient must also have compatible blood types. Once plasma is donated, it is screened for other infectious diseases, such as HIV.Each donor produces enough plasma to treat one to three patients. Donating plasma should not weaken the donor's immune system nor make the donor more susceptible to getting reinfected with the virus.",1
"Currently there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.However, drugs previously developed to treat other viral infections are being tested to see if they might also be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19.",1
"An antiviral drug must be able to target the specific part of a virus's life cycle that is necessary for it to reproduce. In addition, an antiviral drug must be able to kill a virus without killing the human cell it occupies. And viruses are highly adaptive. Because they reproduce so rapidly, they have plenty of opportunity to mutate (change their genetic information) with each new generation, potentially developing resistance to whatever drugs or vaccines we develop.",1
"Currently there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. However, similar to treatment of any viral infection, these measures can help:While you don't need to stay in bed, you should get plenty of rest.Stay well hydrated.To reduce fever and ease aches and pains, take acetaminophen. Be sure to follow directions. If you are taking any combination cold or flu medicine, keep track of all the ingredients and the doses. For acetaminophen, the total daily dose from all products should not exceed 3,000 milligrams.",1
"Some French doctors advise against using ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, many generic versions) for COVID-19 symptoms based on reports of otherwise healthy people with confirmed COVID-19 who were taking an NSAID for symptom relief and developed a severe illness, especially pneumonia. These are only observations and not based on scientific studies.The WHO initially recommended using acetaminophen instead of ibuprofen to help reduce fever and aches and pains related to this coronavirus infection, but now states that either acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used. Rapid changes in recommendations create uncertainty. Since some doctors remain concerned about NSAIDs, it still seems prudent to choose acetaminophen first, with a total dose not exceeding 3,000 milligrams per day.However, if you suspect or know you have COVID-19 and cannot take acetaminophen, or have taken the maximum dose and still need symptom relief, taking over-the-counter ibuprofen does not need to be specifically avoided.",1
"Early reports from China and France suggested that patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 improved more quickly when given chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Some doctors were using a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with some positive effects.Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are primarily used to treat malaria and several inflammatory diseases, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Azithromycin is a commonly prescribed antibiotic for strep throat and bacterial pneumonia. Both drugs are inexpensive and readily available.Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been shown to kill the COVID-19 virus in the laboratory dish. The drugs appear to work through two mechanisms. First, they make it harder for the virus to attach itself to the cell, inhibiting the virus from entering the cell and multiplying within it. Second, if the virus does manage to get inside the cell, the drugs kill it before it can multiply.Azithromycin is never used for viral infections. However, this antibiotic does have some anti-inflammatory action. There has been speculation, though never proven, that azithromycin may help to dampen an overactive immune response to the COVID-19 infection.However, the most recent human studies suggest no benefit — and possibly a higher risk of death due to lethal heart rhythm abnormalities — with both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin used alone. The drugs are especially dangerous when used in combination.Based on these new reports, the FDA now formally recommends against taking chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 infection unless it is being prescribed in the hospital or as part of a clinical trial. Three days earlier a National Institutes of Health (NIH) panel released a similar strong statement advising against the use of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.",1
"Scientists all over the world are testing whether drugs previously developed to treat other viral infections might also be effective against the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.One drug that has received a lot of attention is the antiviral drug remdesivir. That's because the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is similar to the coronaviruses that caused the diseases SARS and MERS — and evidence from laboratory and animal studies suggests that remdesivir may help limit the reproduction and spread of these viruses in the body. In particular, there is a critical part of all three viruses that can be targeted by drugs. That critical part, which makes an important enzyme that the virus needs to reproduce, is virtually identical in all three coronaviruses; drugs like remdesivir that successfully hit that target in the viruses that cause SARS and MERS are likely to work against the COVID-19 virus.Remdesivir was developed to treat several other severe viral diseases, including the disease caused by Ebola virus (not a coronavirus). It works by inhibiting the ability of the coronavirus to reproduce and make copies of itself: if it can't reproduce, it can't make copies that spread and infect other cells and other parts of the body.Remdesivir inhibited the ability of the coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS to infect cells in a laboratory dish. The drug also was effective in treating these coronaviruses in animals: there was a reduction in the amount of virus in the body, and also an improvement in lung disease caused by the virus.
The drug appears to be effective in the laboratory dish, in protecting cells against infection by the COVID virus (as is true of the SARS and MERS coronaviruses), but more studies are underway to confirm that this is true.Remdesivir was used in the first case of COVID-19 that occurred in Washington state, in January 2020. The patient was severely ill, but survived. Of course, experience in one patient does not prove the drug is effective.Two large randomized clinical trials are underway in China. The two trials will enroll over 700 patients, and are likely to definitively answer the question of whether the drug is effective in treating COVID-19. The results of those studies are expected in April or May 2020. Studies also are underway in the United States, including at several Harvard-affiliated hospitals. It is hard to predict when the drug could be approved for use and produced in large amounts, assuming the clinical trials indicate that it is effective and safe.",1
"Some critically ill patients with COVID-19 have been treated with high doses of intravenous (IV) vitamin C in the hope that it will hasten recovery. However, there is no clear or convincing scientific evidence that it works for COVID-19 infections, and it is not a standard part of treatment for this new infection. A study is underway in China to determine if this treatment is useful for patients with severe COVID-19; results are expected in the fall.The idea that high-dose IV vitamin C might help in overwhelming infections is not new. A 2017 study found that high-dose IV vitamin C treatment (along with thiamine and corticosteroids) appeared to prevent deaths among people with sepsis, a form of overwhelming infection causing dangerously low blood pressure and organ failure. Another study published last year assessed the effect of high-dose vitamin C infusions among patients with severe infections who had sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in which the lungs fill with fluid. While the study's main measures of improvement did not improve within the first four days of vitamin C therapy, there was a lower death rate at 28 days among treated patients. Though neither of these studies looked at vitamin C use in patients with COVID-19, the vitamin therapy was specifically given for sepsis and ARDS, and these are the most common conditions leading to intensive care unit admission, ventilator support, or death among those with severe COVID-19 infections.Regarding prevention, there is no evidence that taking vitamin C will help prevent infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. While standard doses of vitamin C are generally harmless, high doses can cause a number of side effects, including nausea, cramps, and an increased risk of kidney stones.",1

"Dealing with daily stress, anxiety, and a range of other emotions. Perhaps you're older, worried that you may become infected and seriously ill. Maybe you're doing your best to keep your family healthy while trying to balance work with caring for your children while schools are closed. Or you're feeling isolated, separated from friends and loved ones during this period of social distancing.Regardless of your specific circumstances, it's likely that you're wondering how to cope with the stress, anxiety, and other feelings that are surfacing. A variety of stress management techniques, which we delve into below, can help.Webinar series: Regulating emotions & building resiliency in the face of a pandemic. This webinar series was created to support the students and staff of the Harvard Medical School community, yet the lessons will be broadly applicable to all who are feeling the emotional strain of this unprecedented crisis.Dr. Luana Marques, is an Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School's Department of Psychiatry and clinical researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who specializes in treating anxiety and stress disorders. Dr. Marques focuses on the science of anxiety and the specific impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our ability to manage stress. Using role plays and examples, she provides clear and accessible skills to help viewers manage their emotions during this very challenging time.The role of anxiety. In this video we focus on how to assess the level of our anxiety, and then we apply some of the concepts of CBT to a particular stressor that many people in our community are experiencing: adapting to the ever-changing timeline of how long we will need to practice social distancing and isolation.Slowing Down the Brain
In this video we focus on skills for reducing the flow of anxious thoughts, particularly as we consume massive amounts of frightening information about the COVID-19 crisis.Charging Up and Staying Connected. In this video we focus on the sense of loss that many of us are experiencing right now as a result of social distancing and how activating our brains and bodies can help us manage those emotions.Exploring Thoughts. In this video we focus on how to interrogate the catastrophic thoughts that many of us are having right now and we offer specific tips for parents who are looking for strategies to help support the emotional health of their children during this crisis.The GAD-7 is a tool that can be used to self-assess your level of anxiety.

"Children, including very young children, can develop COVID-19. Many of them have no symptoms. Those that do get sick tend to experience milder symptoms such as low-grade fever, fatigue, and cough. Some children have had severe complications, but this has been less common. Children with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe illness.A complication that has more recently been observed in children can be severe and dangerous. Called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), it can lead to life-threatening problems with the heart and other organs in the body. Early reports compare it to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory illness that can lead to heart problems. But while some cases look very much like Kawasaki's, others have been different.Symptoms of MIS-C can include, fever lasting more than a couple of days, rash, conjunctivitis (redness of the white part of the eye), stomachache, vomiting and/or diarrhea, a large, swollen lymph node in the neck, red, cracked lips, a tongue that is redder than usual and looks like a strawberry, swollen hands and/or feet irritability and/or unusual sleepiness or weakness.Many conditions can cause these symptoms. Doctors make the diagnosis of MIS-C based on these symptoms, along with a physical examination and medical tests that check for inflammation and how organs are functioning. Call the doctor if your child develops symptoms, particularly if their fever lasts for more than a couple of days. If the symptoms get any worse or just don't improve, call again or bring your child to an emergency room.Doctors have had success using various treatments for inflammation, as well as treatments to support organ systems that are having trouble. While there have been some deaths, most children who have developed MIS-C have recovered.",1
"The answer depends on many factors, including what your doctor's office is offering. As with all health care decisions, it comes down to weighing risks and benefits.
Getting early immunizations in for babies and toddlers — especially babies 6 months and younger — has important benefits. It helps to protect them from infections such as pneumococcus and pertussis that can be deadly, at a time when their immune system is vulnerable. At the same time, they could be vulnerable to complications of COVID-19 should their trip to the doctor expose them to the virus.For children older than 2 years, waiting is probably fine — in most cases. For some children with special conditions, or those who are behind on immunizations, waiting may not be a good idea.The best thing to do is call your doctor's office. Find out what precautions they are taking to keep children safe, and discuss your particular situation, including not only your child's health situation, but also the prevalence of the virus in your community and whether you have been or might have been exposed. Together, you can make the best decision for your child.",1
"Anything that isn't urgent should be postponed until a safer time. This would include checkups for healthy children over 2 years (many practices are postponing checkups even for younger children if they are generally healthy). It would also include follow up appointments for anything that can wait, like a follow-up for ADHD in a child that is doing well socially and academically. Your doctor's office can give you guidance about what can wait — and when to reschedule. Many practices are offering phone or telemedicine visits, and it's remarkable how many things can be addressed that way.Some things, though, do require an in-person appointment, including:Illness or injury that could be serious, such as a child with trouble breathing, significant pain, unusual sleepiness, a high fever that won't come down, or a cut that may need stitches or a bone that may be broken. Call your doctor for guidance as to whether you should bring your child to the office or a local emergency room.Children who are receiving ongoing treatments for a serious medical condition such as cancer, kidney disease, or a rheumatologic disease. These might include chemotherapy, infusions of other medications, dialysis, or transfusions. Your doctor will advise you about any changes in treatments or how they are to be given during the pandemic. Do not skip any appointments unless your doctor tells you to do so.
Checkups for very young children who need vaccines and to have their growth checked. Check with your doctor regarding their current policies and practices.
Checkups and visits for children with certain health conditions. This might include children with breathing problems whose lungs need to be listened to, children who need vaccinations to protect their immune system, children whose blood pressure is too high, children who aren't gaining weight, children who need stitches out or a cast off, or children with abnormal blood tests that need rechecking. If your child is being followed for a medical problem, call your doctor for advice. Together you can figure out when and how your child should be seen.Bottom line: Talk to your doctor. The decision will depend on a combination of factors including your child's condition, how prevalent the virus is in your community, whether you have had any exposures or possible exposures, what safeguards your doctor has put into place, and how you would get to the doctor.",1
"The truth is that the fewer people you and your children are exposed to, the better. However, the reality is that not every family will be able to have a parent at home at all times.All people can do is try to minimize the risk by doing things like:choosing a babysitter who has minimal exposures to other people besides your family. limiting the number of babysitters. If you can keep it to one, that's ideal, but if not keep the number as low as possible
making sure that the babysitter understands that he or she needs to practice social distancing, and needs to let you know (and not come to your house!) if he or she feels at all sick or has a known exposure to COVID-19. having the babysitter limit physical interactions and closeness with your children, to the extent that this is possible. making sure that everyone washes their hands frequently throughout the day, especially before eating.",1
"Ideally, to make social distancing truly effective, there shouldn't be play dates. If you can be reasonably sure that the friend is healthy and has had no contact with anyone who might be sick, then playing with a single friend might be okay, but we can't really be sure if anyone has had contact.Outdoor play dates, where you can create more physical distance, might be a compromise. Something like going for a bike ride, or a hike, allows you to be together while sharing fewer germs (bringing and using hand sanitizer is still a good idea). You need to have ground rules, though, about distance and touching, and if you don't think it's realistic that your children will follow those rules, then don't do the play date even if it is outdoors.You can still go for family hikes or bike rides where you're around to enforce social distancing rules. Family soccer games, cornhole, or badminton in the backyard are also fun ways to get outside.You can also do virtual play dates, using a platform like FaceTime or Skype so children can interact and play without being in the same room.",1
"In a situation where there is no choice — such as if the grandparent lives with the grandchildren — then the family should do everything they can to try to limit the risk of COVID-19. The grandchildren should be isolated as much as possible, as should the parents, so that the overall family risk is as low as possible. Everyone should wash their hands very frequently throughout the day, and surfaces should be wiped clean frequently. Physical contact should be limited to the absolutely necessary; as wonderful as it can be to snuggle with Grandma or Grandpa, now is not the time.",1
"One August day in 2017, a 31-year-old man with a cough boarded a crowded minibus in Madagascar's capital, Antananarivo.The man was dead before he could reach his destination.That touched off the most lethal outbreak of pneumonic plague in decades. By the end of November, more than 2,400 people had been infected and 209 had died.Basketball teams from around the Indian Ocean region were in Madagascar at the time for a championship tournament. A coach from the Seychelles died and a South African player fell ill. The risk of an international outbreak loomed.To stamp it out, health officials needed to break the chains of transmission: find the people who had come into contact with each infected individual and prevent them from spreading the disease to anyone else.It's known as contact tracing. It's the same task that experts now say the United States must dramatically increase as COVID-19 lockdowns loosen. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus.COVID-19 infections will inevitably increase in the coming weeks, they say, and a work force must be standing by to stop new patients from rekindling a widespread outbreak. Tiny Madagascar’s experience could provide the U.S. and other countries with valuable lessons and insights.Eyes and ears. While health officials say the United States will need to hire at least 100,000 contact tracers, Madagascar tapped into a network of community health volunteers who were ready to step in when the outbreak hit.Those volunteers go door to door in communities across the country as health educators. They make sure pregnant women get pre-natal care and children are vaccinated. They treat common ailments, such as malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia.""They're the eyes and ears of the health system,"" said John Yanulis, who directed the program for the nonprofit Management Sciences for Health. ""They are trusted members of their community.""So when the volunteers were called upon to become pneumonic plague contact tracers, the community already knew them and listened to them. People were willing to share information about who was at risk.Pneumonic plague is 100% fatal within days if left untreated. The community health volunteers delivered antibiotics that would prevent infection.Occasionally, though, people would not take them.""Fear, I think, was one of the biggest factors,"" Yanulis said. People ""did not know how to deal with that news"" that they might have been exposed to a lethal disease.Health volunteers would ""go up the chain"" to deal with refusals, he added. They'd call in the head of the local health center, the village watch committee, and even the mayor to ""basically talk it through"" and ""ultimately convince the person that it's not just for your good, it's also for the good of the community.""
Then the volunteer would go back every day during the one-week course of antibiotics to make sure the person took them.The contact tracers were part of a coordinated effort from local, state and national officials, plus international partners, including the World Health Organization.
""In 2½ months, we had a real public health success,"" Yanulis said. New cases dropped sharply in October. On December 4, the WHO declared the outbreak contained.The same volunteers are ""at the ready"" to deal with COVID-19, he added. ""In some cases they are already being oriented and trained.""While they are unpaid in Madagascar, community health workers are on government payrolls in Kenya, Ethiopia, Malawi and other countries in Africa and elsewhere, Yanulis said.People skills. In the United States, states, cities and counties are preparing to hire thousands of people to do the same kind of labor intensive, high-touch work that helped Madagascar contain its outbreak.They don't need much education, Yanulis said. ""It's really about being someone who is comfortable going into the community.""Before COVID-19, much of the contact tracing U.S. health departments did was for sexually transmitted infections, which carry more of a stigma than the coronavirus infection.The process is basically the same, said Tim Heymans, a disease intervention specialist with the Minnesota Department of Health. When he calls a contact, the first question he asks is whether the person can speak privately. ""When you show them that you're trying to protect their privacy, I think that builds trust.""
When he delivers the news, ""they may be shocked at first or are upset or defensive."" Some get angry and don't cooperate, but, he said, ""most of the time within moments, they're giving signs that they're glad that we called and are happy for the advice we're giving them on where they can go to get help with this.""
For the most difficult cases, Heymans said, ""we try to appeal to the person's sense of the greater good and protecting people around them.""'Complicated and messy'COVID-19 contacts need to isolate themselves for 14 days, which can be a lot to ask.A person might be taking care of elderly relatives and young children. Staying at home risks spreading the infection to vulnerable family members, said Adriane Casalotti, governmental and public affairs chief at the National Association of County and City Health Officials.But ""if they leave,"" she asked, ""who's going to help pick up the slack?""Health departments may need to support people in quarantine with housing, food, medicine and even financial help.""People's lives are complicated and messy,"" she said. ""So the public health response ends up being complicated and messy.""Job opportunitiesWith states looking to hire thousands of contact tracers quickly, Johns Hopkins University has developed a five-hour online training course covering the basics of the disease, contact tracing and how it works, and some of the privacy and ethical issues involved.It also covers how to build rapport, ""because ultimately, this is a program about connecting with people and helping support them to stop the spread,"" said course instructor Emily Gurley at Johns Hopkins.Entry-level contact tracing jobs pay in the mid-$30,000 range, according to NACCHO's Casalotti. The organization said Congress needs to provide $7.6 billion for health departments to hire at least 100,000 of them, plus another 10,000 supervisors and 1,600 epidemiologists.With tens of millions of people out of work, there's no shortage of applicants. Massachusetts had 40,000 applicants for 1,000 positions, according to USA Today.
Being out of work is just part of the surge of interest, Casalotti said. ""I think a lot of people are stuck at home and they're watching this all happen outside their windows and they want to help.""When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Casalotti noted, health departments had not recovered from steep budget and staffing cuts made in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Given the economic devastation the pandemic is causing to state and local budgets, she is worried that history will repeat itself.""We're actually really concerned, if this is anything like the 2008 recession, that local departments on the front lines of this response ... will end up being in worse financial shape after coronavirus than they were before,"" she said.",1
"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, social distancing has provided a means to “flatten the curve” and hopefully, reduce the curve. There are significant epidemiological and economic risks and uncertainties to the policies. New estimates for the epidemiological consequences and criterion for when these policies are removed do not tell the full story of social impact by themselves and must be paired with clarity around economic impacts, and how these vary by industry sector.
To better ground the economic costs of remaining in effect, we have estimated the economy-wide impacts of a set of social distancing policies that have been used across the United States. Our estimates provide a sense of the likely economic toll due to these policies.The economic toll is not just tied to those industries directly impacted by these policies such as restaurants and bars, but its impacts are being felt across the board due to supply chain disruptions and a reduction in demand. Weekly unemployment numbers (PDF) cut across every geography, industry, and class. The important interconnections that make an economy strong also provide a means for disruptions to cascade throughout the entire economy.Our results show that the economic costs of these policies vary widely across states, with aggregate income declines of 45 percent in states like Indiana, Wisconsin and Iowa for our worst-case scenario. These results do not take into account the reduction in demand that is likely to arise due to unemployment and households staying home. Based on our national level results, for every week that we have strict social distancing policies in place, we are reducing the Gross National Income (GNI) by approximately 0.5 percent. That is, if these policies are kept in place for three months, it would likely mean a drop of 6 percent due solely to the social distancing policies. If a modest 10 percent reduction in household demand is included, these results increase to a 9 percent drop in GNI.It is important to recognize that these economic costs are balanced by decreasing infection, hospitalization, and deaths. It is up to the state and local decisionmakers to weigh the benefits and costs of these policies. Our hope is that we are helping provide one side of the story.",1

"The controversial Ethiopian politician and Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, claimed in a press conference in early March that the fatality rate for the coronavirus was many multiples that of the fatality rate of the common flu.This egregiously 0 premise has led to the greatest panic in world history.The Director General of the WHO spoke on March 3, 2020 and shared this related to the coronavirus:While many people globally have built up immunity to seasonal flu strains, COVID-19 is a new virus to which no one has immunity. That means more people are susceptible to infection, and some will suffer severe disease.Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.This statement led to the greatest panic in world history as the media all over the world shared and repeated that the coronavirus was many, many times more deadly than the common flu.The problem is his statement is 0.  It was not accurate! The Gateway Pundit reported yesterday, that the coronavirus fatality rate reported by the media was completely inaccurate and the actual rate is less than the current seasonal flu – the media was lying again. The 0 reporting of the coronavirus fatality rate of 3.4% in the media started with the statements made by the WHO in early March.Here’s a summary of the analysis from yesterday proving the Director General’s statement was very misleading and materially 0: The fatality rate of the coronavirus was based on current data available of known positive cases and known deaths.Oftentimes estimates have to be made because data is just not yet available. The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, used the fatality rate of coronavirus with known numbers and used this as his prediction of eventual mortality rate.  This was a faulty assumption.  Estimates usually involve obtaining information that is available and making estimates on what is not. We cannot tell the future but we can make educated guesses based on information available. This is what has been done with the coronavirus because this type of virus has apparently never been seen before.Sometimes estimates are reasonable and sometimes they are wrong, and even way off.The point is that whenever estimates are made of large unknown values they are always wrong because no one can tell the future. Sometimes estimates end up close and sometimes they are not and sometimes they are way off.The current “estimate” for the coronavirus fatality rate according to the WHO is about 3.4%.
The estimate used most often is from the WHO based on the Director General’s comments.  The WHO estimates the mortality rate of the coronavirus to be around 3.4%:The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated the mortality rate from Covid-19 is about 3.4%. That is higher than seasonal flu and is cause for concern – but even if it is correct, more than 96% of people who become infected with the coronavirus will recover.The same rate for this year’s seasonal flu is 10% if you use known cases and known deaths (but the media tells you it’s .1%).As The Gateway Pundit reported earlier, according to CDC numbers, in the US in the 2019-2020 flu season, there were 222,552 confirmed cases of the flu from testing and an estimated 36 million flu cases in the United States. There were 22,000 estimated deaths from the flu (via the CDC).Note that the number of deaths and confirmed cases (through testing) of the flu in the US are based on actual data. The number of individuals who contracted the flu is an estimate. There is no way to know who had the flu in the US because many cases are not severe and people do not have a test done to confirm they had the flu. They believe their symptoms are minor and go on with their normal lives thinking they had a cold or something similar. Because of this, the CDC estimates and they estimated 36 million people had the flu in this past flu season.The rate of the number of individuals who died from the flu to the number of individuals who were estimated to have had the flu is .1% (22,552 / 36 million). This is an estimate and the amount used above by the Director General of the WHO.However, the rate of individuals who died from the flu to the number of individuals who were confirmed to have had the flu is around 10% (22,000/ 222,552). This is based on actual data similar to the rate for the coronavirus above.Actual results for the coronavirus are lower than the flu.Based on the above numbers, the actual fatality rate for those who were confirmed to have had the coronavirus is 3.4%.The actual mortality rates for those who were confirmed to have had the flu are around 10%.The actual data shows that the mortality rate for those who had the flu (10%) is almost twice as high than for those with the coronavirus (3.8%).Current estimates between the flu and the coronavirus are not comparing ‘apples to apples’.The fatality rate that is commonly referred to in the media for the coronavirus is 3.4% from the WHO. This number is based on confirmed cases of people with the coronavirus.The flu fatality rate provided by the CDC of .1% includes an estimate of individuals who had the flu (36,000,000).  This rate includes an estimate of all people with the flu, most who were not tested for the flu.The fatality rate for the coronavirus does not include those who had the coronavirus but were not confirmed. This is why the flu fatality rate is .1% and the coronavirus fatality rate is 3.4%!The two rates are like comparing apples to oranges. By doing so the coronavirus fatality rate is way overstated when compared to the flu and the WHO and the media has created a worldwide crisis and panic by reporting these rates simultaneously!The coronavirus is not more fatal than the flu based on current data available. It is much less fatal than the flu based on current data.Those most at risk from the coronavirus are the elderly and sick (similar to the flu).
Similar to the flu, those most at risk of dying from the coronavirus are the elderly and the sick. The average age for those who died from the coronavirus in Italy is 81 years old. This is consistent around the world. There have been no known fatalities for any children 10 and under.The sick are also at a higher risk similar to the flu. Current data shows that if you have no pre-existing conditions, your fatality rate if you contract the coronavirus is .9% (and what proportion of these cases are the elderly).In summary, President Trump was right when he said the WHO’s coronavirus fatality rate was much too high.Evidence proves the coronavirus is not as deadly as what was reported by the WHO and is continually repeated in the media.In fact, current data shows it is not as deadly as the flu. The elderly and the sick should be concerned and  protected. Everyone else has little to worry about.
Again, don’t believe what the media is telling you. They are lying again.",0
"Breathing deeply for just a few minutes in any of these hot locations will kill a high percentage of any coronavirus that happens to be invading the upper respiratory system. And a second or third exposure about an hour apart will kill the rest. No desert or sauna available? No problem. The common, widely available hand-held blow dryer, used for drying hair, contains a heating element and a fan that instantly deliver forced hot air temperatures that will kill coronavirus even faster,",0
"In view of the dire situation we currently face, with infections in dozens of countries and thousands of fatalities, here is a detailed description of the original Cold-Arrest Procedure with the suggested times and temperatures carefully optimized for coronavirus eradication:Turn hair dryer to the lowest setting and then cup fingers over the air intake to slow the air flow and increase its output temperature.With the other hand, use a wet cloth or a spray bottle filled with water to frequently moisten the facial surface around the nose and mouth. The flow of hot air causes the water to evaporate, keeping the face and nose cool while allowing the heat to penetrating deeply into the nose and sinuses. Take slow, deep breaths through the nose, with mouth closed, for 5 minutes. To minimize any discomfort, turn the blow dryer aside in between breaths so that warm air is directed toward the face and nose only while inhaling. If the air feels warm, but not hot, try a higher heat setting. The goal is to raise the inside of the nose and sinuses to the coronavirus kill temperature of at least of 56° C (133° F) during the entire treatment period. So, use the highest temperature you can safely tolerate.Pause between heat applications for about one hour. This allows time for the natural movement of the mucus layer within the sinuses to reposition any potentially shielded virus to a more exposed location where it can be heated and destroyed.After the cooling period, begin another 5-minute hot air treatment. If no symptoms have appeared, two heating cycles per day should be sufficient for prevention. However, if symptoms have already developed, three to five of these alternating heating/cooling cycles per day are recommended, until symptoms disappear.If widely used as an added prevention step, along with wearing a mask and handwashing, this Cold-Arrest hyperthermia therapy has the potential of helping to halt any further spread of Covid-19. It also offers an important psychological benefit for those who are currently in isolation, quarantine, or lockdown for a prolonged viral incubation period. Instead of just waiting, helplessly, to see if symptoms develop, patients can take a proactive role by exterminating any virus that may be present.",0
"Dr. Benjamin Neuman, an expert in coronaviruses who chairs the Biological Sciences department at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, said the sauna, desert and hair dryer methods would not be effective.“Breathing from saunas or a hair dryer would not have any effect on preventing or treating coronavirus, and both are downright weird,” Neuman told AFP by email, adding that relying on desert air for that purpose is “equally insane.”“There isn't any strong evidence connecting environmental temperature to the transmission of coronavirus -- it's more about how long you spend in close proximity to an infected person,” he said.“I could think of as many reasons why it would potentially exacerbate an infection as reasons why it might help.”Dr. Karine Le Roch -- a professor of cell biology at the University of California, Riverside -- echoed Neuman’s analysis.“So far there is ABSOLUTELY no evidence that the COVID-19 virus can be treated via heat,” Le Roch told AFP by email.Regarding using a hair dryer, “there is ABSOLUTELY no scientific evidence that it can prevent you from catching COVID-19 or treating the novel coronavirus,” she added.The WHO says current evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus “can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather.”None of the methods advocated in the video appear on the WHO’s page offering advice to the public about the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says on its novel coronavirus frequently asked questions page: “It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19.”None of the methods suggested in the video appear on the CDC’s page on how to protect against the virus, nor this page about caring for yourself if you are sick.
The novel coronavirus originated in China in late 2019 but it has spread globally, killing more than 9,000 people, wreaking economic havoc from Asia to Europe and the United States in a public health crisis that governments are struggling to halt.",1

Several friends and family members flew in on later flights, including religious leader Al Sharpton, actor Jussie Smolette, and basketball star Joe Barron.The multi-billion dollar island, dubbed “Smoovy-O-Town” on nautical charts is over thirty-six miles in area.

She has since deleted the tweet (""Management has asked me to delete vid/articles,"" she wrote in a follow-up tweet) but apparently got it from someone with 839,000 Instagram followers going by ""chakabars,"" from a completely random chiropractor named Gloriane Giovanelli, and from the Wikipedia quick-fact snippet appearing on a search for ""Who invented 5G?'""Hilson's most striking source is a completely insane video, which she posted to her Instagram, where a man with his name tag turned backwards claims that the 1918 flu pandemic was caused by the invention of radio, some undescribed pandemic during World War II was caused by ""Radar fields,"" and a 1968 flu in Hong Kong was caused by ""satellites emitting radioactive frequencies.""""In the last six months, with the electrification of the Earth … it's called 5G,"" the unnamed man says, going on to spout more utter word salad, including ""the first completely blanketed 5G city in the world was … Wuhan, China.""Hilson is not the only celeb to spread 5G coronavirus nonsense on social media. As the Times notes, John Cusack and Woody Harrelson have done the same.The Truth About 5G.5G isn't a new, higher frequency. It's just an encoding standard, which can work on many kinds of airwaves. In the UK and China, 5G operates on a band that's sandwiched between existing 4G networks and 5GHz Wi-Fi. That band is extremely similar to current LTE bands in behavior, and it is lower-frequency than the band used for high-speed Wi-Fi since 2009.Most of the 5G out there—including the 5G used in the UK—is just a slightly different way of encoding data on airwaves that are no higher-frequency than those used by Wi-Fi, and no lower-frequency than those used by televisions. Here in the US, most of the ""5G"" you see is just a slightly different form of encoding on airwaves that have been used for nearly 100 years. T-Mobile's low-band 5G is on old UHF TV channels. UHF TV did not cause coronavirus. AT&T's low-band 5G is on cellular frequencies used since 1983, and it is no more powerful. Sprint's 5G is on 4G frequencies that have been used since 2007.Yes, some new, higher frequencies—called millimeter-wave (mmWave)—are being used in the US (not the UK), but they have almost no coverage right now, much as Verizon's marketing would like you to think otherwise. Even though you probably have never encountered it, because it has almost no coverage, mmWave 5G has been certified as safe by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. The technology has been studied for several years now, with the only negative effects detected being a slight heating effect at power levels far above what the FCC permits any transmitter to operate at. Citywide 5G was also available in the US and the UK before it was available in China. While China did indeed launch 5G in 50 cities on Nov. 1, UK carrier EE launched 5G last May, and Sprint launched broad-coverage 5G in nine US cities last summer (which we covered.) The US and UK have been ""blanketed"" with 5G for months longer than China has.COVID-19 is spreading in places that do not have 5G. Iran, a major hotspot, does not have 5G. Malaysia, another hotspot, does not have 5G. And so on. There is no correlation between increased spread and the presence of 5G. Italy has 5G and the virus went wild; Iran does not, and the virus went wild.
Debunking That Dumb UK Petition. The specific Change.org argument in the UK seems to be related to a recent news story about the 60GHz band (not MHz) being approved late last year for unlicensed 5G use in Europe. But that band was approved for, and has been used for, unlicensed networking technologies since 2009. The only new move was to add one encoding standard to the list of existing standards available at 60GHz.No 5G network is currently using 60GHz or has plans to do so in the near future. But 60GHz networks have also existed for quite some time with no damage to anyone. The ""Soli"" feature in the Google Pixel 4 uses 60GHz. The frequency is the basis of the WiGig file-transfer technology, which has appeared in some laptops and phones since 2016. And 60GHz has been used as a metro-area internet backhaul transmission frequency for a decade now in places like Courtenay, BC. If there was an inherent problem with 60GHz, it would have shown up in one of those applications, but it hasn't.Stay safe, folks. Stay inside. Don't listen to craziness.",1
"5G is a new radio technology, so naturally those most concerned about environmental health have been asking if it's safe. New antennas are going up outside apartment windows, and most of us tend to keep our phones quite close to us at all times. There's a lot of science on the subject, and also a lot of pseudo-science. We try to cut through the bull to explain the safety issues with radio waves in general, cell phones in particular, and what makes 5G different.We're going to start by explaining the terminology used for this topic, because there are some common misconceptions about what these terms mean. Then we're going to cover radio waves in general, because there are important, relevant principles that apply to all radio waves, including all cell phones, and all 5G technology. Finally, we'll get into what makes ""5G"" unique.Also, if you're concerned about this topic because you came across an alarming article or TV segment about the dangers of 5G, make sure that wasn't actually Russian propaganda designed to hold back the US technologically and economically. Because yes, the Russians are doing exactly that.
Terminology.When looking into whether phones might pose any kind of health risk to humans, it doesn't take long to run into scary-sounding terms like ""radiation"", ""absorption"", and ""safe power levels"". You also quickly run into summaries of research that seem to leave a lot of wiggle room, or include alarming statements like ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"". In order to approach this topic rationally, it's vital to take a step back and understand what these terms mean in context. These statements are written by scientists, who strive to use language that is scientifically accurate. But what those same terms mean to you and I is often quite different.
For example, the term ""radiation"" comes up a lot. If you're like me, your mind might jump to something like Chernobyl when you hear this term. But the dictionary definition for the word ""radiation"" is ""emitting energy in the form of waves or particles"". So it's very broad and includes a great many things, most of which have nothing to do with radioactive particles. Phones ""radiate"" radio waves the same way a speaker radiates sound, or a fireplace radiates warmth. That's all ""radiation"" means to a scientist.You'll also see the term ""absorption"", in reference to human flesh absorbing radio waves. This might also sound scary. Your body can absorb many frequencies of radio waves, which means the atoms in your tissue are, in some incredibly-tiny-but-measurable way, interacting with those waves. (And unless you live in a deep cave or faraday cage, your body does absorb radio waves all day, every day.) Asking what effect those waves have on your body is a valid question to ask. The short version is that it's like putting your hand in front of a flashlight; your hand absorbs most radio waves the same way it absorbs most light, with the same risk to your health. (More on this later.)Scientists and researchers tend to err on the side of caution when studying health risks. They're careful to acknowledge unknowns and risks, however small. It's a bit like ads for medical drugs. An ad on TV might tell you that taking a drug could lead to death, just because one person died during a clinical trial, even if there's no evidence the drug was related to that death. But your doctor knows more about those trials and can tell you that the drug is extremely safe. Similarly, you'll probably never see a reputable study that unequivocally declares ""cell phones are safe"". As much as the average person would like to hear that, that's simply not how serious scientific research works. The best we can hope for is ample research showing that if any health risk exists, that risk is very small. (And that is exactly where we are. More on this later.)But as long as there are risk levels and uncertainty, however insignificant, there will be scary phrasing like the ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" classification of radio waves by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Eeek! Out of context, that does sound scary, right? But let's put it in context. First of all, their category for ""possible"" is distinct from their category for ""probable"", and even when they say ""probable"", it doesn't mean a link has been proven. Other items in the ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" category include coffee, the power lines inside your house, and baby powder. Finally, this ""possibly carcinogenic"" classification for radio waves is for all radio waves, not just cell phones. The world has been full of all kinds of radio waves for a hundred years, with no major ill effect.The electromagnetic spectrum.As you may recall from school, radiofrequency (RF) waves exist on the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes visible light, x-rays, and gamma rays.There is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be harmful to humans, and it's everything above visible light. That includes some ultraviolet light (which is why we use sunscreen), x-rays, and gamma rays. X-rays and gamma rays are ionizing radiation, which means they have enough energy to change the makeup of atoms (by removing an electron.) In humans, that can damage DNA, which raises the risk of cancer.Radio waves are below visible light on the spectrum, along with infrared light. This is the safe — or non-ionizing — side of the spectrum, where frequencies — and thus energy levels — are too low to knock electrons out of atoms. That limits the kinds of effects radio waves can have on human tissue and DNA.Note that ""energy"" in this context is not the same as power level (strength). Think of it like your teeth. An ultrasonic toothbrush (or a dentist's ultrasonic pick) uses super-fast vibrations (high frequencies) to make plaque and tartar practically fly off your teeth. That's analogous to how the high frequencies of gamma rays have enough ""energy"" to knock electrons out of atoms. However if you just tap your teeth quickly with your knuckle, you might be applying much more force (a higher power level), but you'd be accomplishing nothing, because of the much lower frequency (your hand muscles can't vibrate your knuckle thousands of times per second.)Radio waves can interact with and affect matter, but generally only in the same way as their neighbors on the electromagnetic spectrum, infrared light and visible light. That is by vibrating atoms, which humans experience as heat.So that's really all that radio waves are capable of doing to humans: heating them up. In fact, that's exactly how a microwave oven works. But the power levels are very different. (Good luck running a microwave oven on batteries!) That's part of why the FCC regulates radio power levels: to make sure no one is getting cooked. Of course, if you were getting cooked by radio waves – or even just slightly warmed up – you'd feel it.Who should you trust?There are many studies by industry groups on this subject, but I wouldn't blame anyone for not trusting any industry when it comes to whether its own products are safe.How about the government? The FDA has investigated the issue in depth and determined that cell phones are safe, and set radio emission power level limits below ""safe"" levels just to be extra-safe. Those limits are enforced by the FCC. Those limits were created by non-political career scientists and haven't changed during various administrations, regardless of whether those in power were considered more business-friendly or consumer-friendly. The FDA, FCC, and CDC all agree that the issue has been studied, and no clear evidence of danger has been found. And yet, plenty of people simply don't trust the government, so let's see if we can find a group that's more unbiased and above reproach.That leads us to the American Cancer Society (ACS). If you're not familiar, they are one of the oldest and most highly-respected non-profit organizations devoted to researching and fighting cancer. They were instrumental in exposing cigarettes as a carcinogen. Their staff numbers well over 5,000, they're independent, and their only agenda is fighting cancer.Are radio waves safe?You should read all of what the ACS has to say on the subject. It's very comprehensive. But to sum up:The RF waves given off by cell phones don’t have enough energy to damage DNA directly or to heat body tissues. Because of this, it’s not clear how cell phones might be able to cause cancer. Most studies done in the lab have supported the idea that RF waves do not cause DNA damage.
Specifically regarding studies on humans, they have this to say:In most studies patients with brain tumors do not report more cell phone use overall than the controls. This finding is true when all brain tumors are considered as a group, or when specific types of tumors are considered.Most studies do not show a “dose-response relationship,” which would be a tendency for the risk of brain tumors to be higher with increasing cell phone use. This would be expected if cell phone use caused brain tumors.Most studies do not show that brain tumors occur more often on the side of the head where people hold their cell phones. This might also be expected if cell phone use caused brain tumors.They also mention a Swedish study that did claim to find a small link on that last point, but also:It is hard to know what to make of these findings because most studies by other researchers have not had the same results, and there is no overall increase in brain tumors in Sweden during the years that correspond to these reports.If there was a remotely significant risk of cancer from cell phones, you would expect the ACS to be setting off alarm bells. They are not; quite the opposite, as you can see above. The majority of studies show that there is no risk, or if there is, it is incredibly small.What about heat?Cancer is not the only concern, though. As the FDA notes, heating (the microwave-oven effect) can be a particular concern in certain body parts:While RF energy doesn’t ionize particles, large amounts can increase body temperatures and cause tissue damage. Two areas of the body, the eyes and the testes, are particularly vulnerable to RF heating because there is relatively little blood flow in them to carry away excess heat.
The key phrase is ""large amounts"". The power levels put out by phones simply aren't enough to heat up human tissue. The absolute maximum legal limit for radio energy output of a cell phone is 1/1,000th that of a microwave oven. And modern phones almost never transmit at anywhere near that level. Phones use many sophisticated technologies to make sure they're outputting the absolute minimum amount of radio energy at any given moment, simply to conserve battery life.
Also, the way most of us use our phones, your phone receives far more than it transmits. A phone that's strictly downloading data isn't outputting any radio energy at all. (Phones are almost always uploading and downloading, but it's very heavily skewed to the download side in most situations.)To reach the maximum RF power level output from your phone, (which is still about 1/2,000th that of a microwave oven,) you'd need to do something like broadcast live-stream video from your phone in a part of your network with relatively poor coverage. Even then, the leading research says you should be fine. But if you're skeptical, maybe don't hold your phone against your eyeballs or testicles (if you have them) while you engage in that (very specific) activity.
And what is the ""risk"" here? Not cancer; we've established that. We're talking about your eyeball being a fraction of a degree warmer, for likely just few minutes. That's a risk I'm fine with.What makes 5G different. There are two ""flavors"" of 5G: mmWave and non-mmWave. In the US, both are being deployed. It's important to make the distinction. mmWave stands for millimeter wave, and refers the frequency. It's only the mmWave type of 5G that requires new kinds of antennas in new places, because the frequencies are much higher. If you're seeing those antennas being installed on light poles in your neighborhood, those are mmWave antennas.Some companies are deploying 5G in existing frequency bands also used for 4G – not mmWave – and using essentially the same kinds of antennas you're used to seeing for decades on towers and rooftops. Sprint is doing this exclusively for its 5G network so far; they're not using mmWave at all. This flavor of 5G (sometimes call sub-6 GHz) is no different from 4G when it comes to the way it affects the human body.(In fact, the 5G standard is heavily based on the 4G standard. One dirty secret of the industry is that the 5G standard is barely a new standard at all, but more like an evolution of the 4G standard.). So when people say 5G is a new thing that requires further study on its health effects, they're technically talking about mmWave frequency bands, not the 5G standard itself.
As for mmWave, it's still just radio waves, and all radio waves are non-ionizing, which is the ""safe"" end of the electromagnetic spectrum, as explained above.
But if anything, mmWave frequencies are far ""safer"" than other radio frequency bands (not to say those are dangerous.) That's because radio waves at frequencies that high don't penetrate solids well, including your body. The outer layers of your skin block the signal quite well, as do walls and even glass. That's why a mmWave 5G network needs so many antennas spread around town, so close together. It needs a dense mesh of antennas to provide decent coverage given how poorly it penetrates anything solid.So when it comes to physics and the human body, the only new thing about 5G is that the mmWave flavor of it is too weak to even reach your insides, much less cause any health effects to them.mmWave radio energy can only reach your skin. There, all it can theoretically do is heat it up, although it's not powerful enough to actually do so. Even if it could, your skin is the one part of your body best-equipped to shed any excess heat; in fact that's part of its function.",1
"Viruses cannot live in the hot environments. That’s why your body raises temperature when you get sick. If you feel sick, go to sauna and sit there for couple hours, alternate 15 mins in and out. Do it daily if you have chronic cough or sinus infection. Infrared sauna works best. Here is more you can do to protect yourself:
- Drink hot beverages such as peppermint, burdock root, turmeric, hibiscus, and ginger tea, especially first thing in the morning.
- Use antiviral essential oils such as eucalyptus, peppermint, lemon, and cinnamon.
- Avoid being around people who invoke the feeling of fear and panic in you. Fear weakens your immune system and blocks body’s natural defense mechanisms. Always remember - love and joy strengthen your immune system.
- Eat fresh organic garlic and onions daily (don’t buy fake garlic imported from China; real garlic must have hair at the bottom).
- Plant based diet is best when immune system needs a boost. Avoid meat, dairy, soy, gluten, and caffeine. These substances create toxic metabolic byproducts and burden your body with additional stress.
- Take Glutathione and Astaxanthin supplements daily. They help to reduce inflammation in the body and decrease the presence of C-reactive protein, which is an indicator of inflammation.",0

Taiwanese experts provide simple self-monitoring that we can do every morning. Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you can do this successfully without coughing and without difficulty, without anxiety and chest tightness,it shows that you do not have fibrosis and generally indicate no infection. Check yourself every morning in a fresh air environment. The Japanese physician treating COVID-19 provides the best advice on preventing this: Everyone should make sure the mouth and throat are always moist.Drink some water every 15 minutes. Why not? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other fluids will help wash it down the esophagus into the stomach.

"We don't know if changing seasons will help stem the outbreak, says Michael Le Page. WILL the covid-19 outbreakcaused by the new coronavirus fade as winter in the northern hemisphere comes to an end? This has been suggested by some researchers and repeated by some political leaders, including US president Donald Trump.“We absolutely don't know that,” says Trudie Lang at the University of Oxford. “I keep asking virologist colleagues this and nobody knows. So when you hear people say the weather will warm up and it will just disappear, it's a very unhelpful generalisation.”This is essentially what Trump said on 10 February. “The heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus,” he told a meeting. “A lot of people think that goes away in April as the heat comes in.”Trump isn't the only politician to make this sort of claim. The UK's health secretary, Matt Hancock, recently told ITV reporter Tom Clarke that the hope was to slow the spread of the virus so any epidemic reaches the UK in spring and summer when coronaviruses, of which the new virus is just a specific example, are less transmissible.One scenario is that it will burn itself out in summer, another that it will reduce but then return in winter. It is thought the virus – known as 2019-nCoV – can survive for up to four days on surfaces. Some researchers, including Paul Hunter at the University of East Anglia, UK, do think the new coronavirus won't survive for as long in warmer conditions.“One extreme scenario is that it will burn itself out sometime in the summer,” says Hunter. “The other extreme scenario is that it will reduce in the summer but it will come back again in the winter and become what we call endemic, in that it will spread pretty much everywhere.”However, if it is more infectious in cooler conditions, there is an increased chance of it spreading faster in the southern hemisphere as conditions there cool in the coming months. David Heymann at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the global response to the SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2003, points out that the MERS coronavirus has spread in Saudi Arabia in August, when it is very hot. “These viruses can certainly spread during high temperature seasons,” he says.It is thought one reason why flu spreads less readily in summer is that people spend less time together in confined spaces. In particular, it could be linked to school closures, says John Edmunds, also at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.However, children tend to spread flu because they have less immunity to it than adults, who have been exposed to many strains. This isn't the case for the new coronavirus: fewer cases have been reported in young people, though this may be just because they are less likely to become seriously ill.

"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.",1

Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms.
Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.  However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.  People of all ages who experience fever and/or  cough associated withdifficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately. If possible, it is recommended to call the health care provider or facility first, so the patient can be directed to the right clinic.",1

Quarantine means restricting activities or separating people who are not ill themselves but may have been exposed to COVID-19. The goal is to prevent spread of the disease at the time when people just develop symptoms.Isolation means separating people who are ill with symptoms of COVID-19 and may be infectious to prevent the spread of the disease.Physical distancing means being physically apart.

Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.
Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.",1

"Currently, there is not enough evidence for or against the use of masks (medical or other) in healthy individuals in the wider community. However, WHO is actively studying the rapidly evolving science on masks and continuously updates its guidance.Medical masks are recommended primarily in health care settings, but can be considered in other circumstances (see below). Medical masks should be combined with other key infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing.Healthcare workers. Why? Medical masks and respirators such as N95, FFP2 or equivalent are recommended for and should be reserved for, healthcare workers while giving care to patients. Close contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their surrounding environment are the main routes of transmission, which means healthcare workers are the most exposed.People who are sick and exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19. Why? Anyone who is sick, with mild symptoms such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue, should isolate at home and use a medical mask according to WHO’s recommendation on home care of patients with suspected COVID-19. Coughing, sneezing or talking can generate droplets that cause can spread the infection. These droplets can reach the face of others nearby and land on the surrounding environment. If an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks while wearing a medical mask, this can help to protect those nearby from infection. If a sick person needs to go to a health facility they should wear a medical mask.
Anyone taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19. Why? Those caring for individuals who are sick with COVID-19 should wear a medical mask for protection. Again, close, frequent and prolonged contact with someone with COVID-19 puts caretakers at high risk. National decision makers may also choose to recommend medical mask use for certain individuals using a risk-based approach. This approach takes into consideration the purpose of the mask, risk of exposure and vulnerability of the wearer, the setting, the feasibility of use and the types of masks to be considered.",1

"Which surfaces are the most infectious and how do you disinfect them? Experts weigh in.Touching any surface suddenly seems dangerous in the era of the new coronavirus.Fingers might pick up the microbe, which could lead to COVID-19 — the illness spreading around the world — when a person touches his or her face.
How long does coronavirus live outside the body?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates it could be viable for “hours to days.”A preliminary study published this week found the virus could be detected in the air for up to three hours after it was aerosolized with a nebulizer, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.The newest research, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was conducted by scientists at the National Institutes of Health, Princeton University, the University of California and the CDC.Previously published studies have indicated coronaviruses in general — not specifically the new one — can last up to nine days on surfaces depending on the surface type, the heat, the humidity, exposure to sunlight and other factors, said Joseph Fair, a virologist, epidemiologist and NBC News Science contributor.
“Coronaviruses have been with us for millions of years — not this one, but other coronaviruses,” Fair told TODAY.Since there’s no definitive data on the new bug yet, scientists have to err on the side of caution about how long it can stay active, he added.It’s important to note there hasn’t been a documented case of a person getting infected from a surface contaminated with the new coronavirus, according to the CDC.Transmission usually happens when people come in direct contact with respiratory droplets produced when a nearby infected person coughs or sneezes.
How does that compare to other germs?The flu virus can stay active on some surfaces for up to 48 hours, according to the CDC.The Ebola virus can survive on doorknobs and countertops for several hours.The norovirus can survive up to four weeks on surfaces, said Charles Gerba, a professor of microbiology and immunology at The University of Arizona.Some bacteria can last much longer, Fair said.What affects how long the coronavirus stays active?Fair called sunlight “nature’s greatest disinfectant” because the ultraviolet light inactivates bacteria and viruses.Yes, the less porous a surface, the more virus you will get on your hands when you touch it, Gerba said.“You will pick up on your finger 70% of the viruses on stainless steel surfaces versus only 1% from a cloth surface or money,” he noted.That being said, Fair advised people to avoid handling cash, which he called “one of the most filthy things in our society, period.” Paper money is made of cotton, an absorbable surface that can get wet. The new coronavirus can potentially stay active on it for up to nine days just like on other surfaces, he said.Which surfaces are the most infectious?Any that are touched the most often, Fair said. That includes bathroom faucet handles, doorknobs, elevator buttons, hand rails and touchscreens on phones, tablets, and ATMs.They’re the dirtiest surfaces we come into contact with because so many people touch them.What kills viruses?Common cleaners with either bleach or alcohol as their active ingredient inactivate infectious viruses, Fair said.Coronaviruses are fairly sensitive to most disinfectants, including bleach, hydrogen peroxide and quaternary ammonium compounds, Gerba added. If the label says the cleaner will kill the influenza virus or norovirus, it will work against coronaviruses, too.“I would use disinfecting wipes because then you use the right dose of disinfectant and you usually let it dry so you get the right contact time for the disinfectant to work,” he noted.How often should you disinfect surfaces?Several times per day, especially frequently-touched items like a computer keyboard, phones and tablets, Fair advised.“It’s very good practice because those are the filthiest areas in your life,” he said.",1
"The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus continues to grow daily. Readers have asked whether the origin of mail and purchased items could affect them.
The United States has more than 100 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and new infections are being reported daily. On Tuesday, Amazon said it recently had a Seattle-based employee test positive for covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. A spokesperson for Amazon told The Washington Post that the ill employee is in quarantine. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Post.). Many of the retailer’s merchants and suppliers are based in China, where one city, Wuhan, became known as ground zero for the virus. That connection has led many readers to question whether they should be fearful of parcels coming from affected areas in China or elsewhere.The simple scientific answer, according to epidemiologists: No.“There’s no evidence that there’s been spread from infected mail or packages,” said Michael Merson, a dean’s special adviser at the New York University School of Global Public Health.Merson, who is also director of the SingHealth Duke-National University of Singapore Global Health Institute, said lab studies have shown the virus can survive up to eight or nine days, but he stressed that factors such as temperature and humidity play a factor in such research.“If I put anything on a surface, that doesn’t tell us about the real world,” he said, noting the virus is mostly spread through droplet infections. “We just don’t have any evidence that this has ever been a problem.”The virus does not last long on objects such as letters or packages, according to the World Health Organization.If people are ordering internationally, contracting the virus is even less of a concern, said Xi Chen, assistant professor of public and global health and economics at the Yale School of Public Health.
Chen said viruses similar to the coronavirus, such as SARS and MERS, like low temperatures and low humidity, which aren’t consistent in transit.
Proper hand-washing and touching your face less are the best protections against the coronavirus, said Amar Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.“It’s important to be alert, but it’s not a time to panic,” he said. “The vast majority of cases are going to be mild.”",1
"Due to the Corona Virus, the polls will remain closed and the election is cancelled. Trump will remain president for the next 4 years.(Watch how quickly the epidemic is over)",0
"The most commonly reported mainstream media account of the creation of the Coronavirus suggests that it was derived from an animal borne microorganism found in a wild bat that was consumed by an ethnic Chinese resident of Wuhan. But there appears to be some evidence to dispute that in that adjacent provinces in China, where wild bats are more numerous, have not experienced major outbreaks of the disease. Because of that and other factors, there has also been considerable speculation that the Coronavirus did not occur naturally through mutation but rather was produced in a laboratory, possibly as a biological warfare agent.Several reports suggest that there are components of the virus that are related to HIV that could not have occurred naturally. If it is correct that the virus had either been developed or even produced to be weaponized it would further suggest that its escape from the Wuhan Institute of Virology Lab and into the animal and human population could have been accidental. Technicians who work in such environments are aware that “leaks” from laboratories occur frequently.There is, of course and inevitably, another theory. There has been some speculation that as the Trump Administration has been constantly raising the issue of growing Chinese global competitiveness as a direct threat to American national security and economic dominance, it must might be possible that Washington has created and unleashed the virus in a bid to bring Beijing’s growing economy and military might down a few notches. It is, to be sure, hard to believe that even the Trump White House would do something so reckless, but there are precedents for that type of behavior. In 2005-9 the American and Israeli governments secretly developed a computer virus called Stuxnet, which was intended to damage the control and operating systems of Iranian computers being used in that country’s nuclear research program. Admittedly Stuxnet was intended to damage computers, not to infect or kill human beings, but concerns that it would propagate and move to infect computers outside Iran proved to be accurate as it spread to thousands of PCs outside Iran, in countries as far flung as China, Germany, Kazakhstan and Indonesia.Inevitably there is an Israeli story that just might shed some light on what has been going on in China. Scientists at Israel’s Galilee Research Institute are now claiming that they will have a vaccine against coronavirus in a few weeks which will be ready for distribution and use within 90 days. The institute is claiming that it has been engaged in four years of research on avian coronavirus funded by Israel’s Ministries of Science & Technology and Agriculture. They are claiming that the virus is similar to the version that has infected humans, which has led to breakthroughs in development through genetic manipulation, but some scientists are skeptical that a new vaccine could be produced so quickly to prevent a virus that existed only recently. They also have warned that even if a vaccine is developed it would normally have to be tested for side effects, a process that normally takes over a year and includes using it on infected humans.If one even considers it possible that the United States had a hand in creating the coronavirus at what remains of its once extensive biological weapons research center in Ft Detrick Maryland, it is very likely that Israel was a partner in the project. Helping to develop the virus would also explain how Israeli scientists have been able to claim success at creating a vaccine so quickly, possibly because the virus and a treatment for it were developed simultaneously.In any event, there are definite political ramifications to the appearance of the coronavirus, and not only in China. In the United States President Donald Trump is already being blamed for lying about the virus and there are various scenarios in mainstream publications speculating over the possible impact on the election in 2020. If the economy sinks together with the stock market, it will reflect badly on Trump whether or not he is actually at fault. If containment and treatment of the disease itself in the United States does not go well, there could also be a considerable backlash, particularly as the Democrats have been promoting improving health care. One pundit argues, however, that disease and a sinking economy will not matter as long as there is a turnaround before the election, but a lot can happen in the next eight months.And then there is the national security/foreign policy issue as seen from both Jerusalem and Washington. It is difficult to explain why coronavirus has hit one country in particular other than China very severely. That country is Iran, the often-cited enemy of both the U.S. and Israel. The number of Iran’s coronavirus cases continues to increase, with more positive tests confirmed among government officials last Saturday. There were 205 new coronavirus cases, bringing the government claimed total to 593 with 43 fatalities, though unofficial hospital reports suggest that the deaths are actually well over 100. That’s the highest number of deaths from the virus outside of China.No less than five Iranian Members of Parliament have also tested positive amid a growing number of officials that have contracted the disease. Iran’s vice president Masoumeh Ebtekar and deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi had also previously been confirmed with the virus.The usual suspects in the United States are delighted to learn of the Iranian deaths. Mark Dubowitz, Executive Director of the Washington-based but Israeli government connected Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) boasted on twitter Tuesday that “Coronavirus has done what American economic sanctions could not: shut down non-oil exports.” An Iranian government spokesman responded that “It’s shameful and downright inhuman to cheer for a deadly Virus to spread – and enjoy seeing people suffer for it…” Dubowitz followed up with an additional taunt, that Tehran has “spread terrorism” in the Middle East and “now it’s spreading the coronavirus.”So, you have your choice. Coronavirus occurred naturally, or it came out of a lab in China itself or even from Israel or the United States. If one suspects Israel and/or the United States, the intent clearly would have been to create a biological weapon that would damage two nations that have been designated as enemies. But the coronavirus cannot be contained easily and it is clear that many thousands of people will die from it. Unfortunately, as with Stuxnet, once the genie is out of the bottled it is devilishly hard to induce it to go back in.",0
"A former American counter-terrorism specialist and military intelligence officer of the CIA has said that the “Coronavirus did not occur naturally through mutation but rather was produced in a laboratory, possibly as a biological warfare agent.”Since the novel coronavirus outbreak began in China last December, it has infected more than 90,000 people globally and killed more than 3,000. The majority of cases and deaths remain in mainland China.The death toll from the coronavirus in Iran, which has one of the highest numbers outside China, stood at 107, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said Thursday.“Several reports suggest that there are components of the virus that are related to HIV that could not have occurred naturally. If it is correct that the virus had either been developed or even produced to be weaponized it would further suggest that its escape from the Wuhan Institute of Virology Lab and into the animal and human population could have been accidental. Technicians who work in such environments are aware that “leaks” from laboratories occur frequently,” Philip Giraldi wrote in an article published by the Strategic Culture Foundation on Thursday.“There is, of course and inevitably, another theory. There has been some speculation that as the Trump Administration has been constantly raising the issue of growing Chinese global competitiveness as a direct threat to American national security and economic dominance, it might be possible that Washington has created and unleashed the virus in a bid to bring Beijing’s growing economy and military might down a few notches. It is, to be sure, hard to believe that even the Trump White House would do something so reckless, but there are precedents for that type of behavior,” he said.“In 2005-9 the American and Israeli governments secretly developed a computer virus called Stuxnet, which was intended to damage the control and operating systems of Iranian computers being used in that country’s nuclear research program. Admittedly Stuxnet was intended to damage computers, not to infect or kill human beings, but concerns that it would propagate and move to infect computers outside Iran proved to be accurate as it spread to thousands of PCs outside Iran, in countries as far flung as China, Germany, Kazakhstan and Indonesia,” he added.“If one even considers it possible that the United States had a hand in creating the coronavirus at what remains of its once extensive biological weapons research center in Ft Detrick Maryland, it is very likely that Israel was a partner in the project. Helping to develop the virus would also explain how Israeli scientists have been able to claim success at creating a vaccine so quickly, possibly because the virus and a treatment for it were developed simultaneously,” he noted.",0

"Coronavirus infects the lungs. The two main symptoms are a fever or a dry cough. These can lead to breathing problems and shortness of breathe.The cough to look out for is a new, continuous cough. This means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or having three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours. If you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual.You have a fever if your temperature is above 37.8C. This can make you feel warm, cold or shivery.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published an expanded list of symptoms which some people may develop:Chills.Repeated shaking with chills.Muscle pain.Headache.Sore throat.New loss of taste or smell.It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, but some people will get them much later. The World Health Organization says the incubation period lasts up to 14 days.",1
"The proportion dying from the disease is likely below 1% - but there will still be uncertainty until better testing reveals how many people have been infected.
Coronavirus death rate: What are the chances of dying?A World Health Organization (WHO) examination of data from 56,000 patients suggests: 6% become critically ill - lung failure, septic shock, organ failure and risk of death. 14% develop severe symptoms - difficulty breathing and shortness of breath. 80% develop mild symptoms - fever and cough and some may have pneumonia",1
"The UK government's scientific advisers believe that the chances of dying from a coronavirus infection are between 0.5% and 1%.This is lower than the rate of death among confirmed cases - which is 4% globally in WHO figures and 5% in the UK as of March 23 - because not all infections are confirmed by testing.Each country has its own way of deciding who gets tested, so comparing case numbers or apparent death rates across countries can also be misleading.Death rates also depend on a range of factors like your age and general health, and the care you can access.What are the risks for people like me?
The elderly and the unwell are more likely to die, if they contract coronavirus.Current estimates from Imperial College London are that the death rate is almost 10 times higher than average for those over 80, and much lower for those under 40.The UK government's chief medical advisor, Professor Chris Whitty, says even though the rates are higher for older people, ""the great majority of older people will have a mild or moderate disease"".He also warns that we should not think it's a trivial infection for younger people, pointing out that there are some young people who have ended up in intensive care.It's not just age that determines the risk of infections.In the first big analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, deaths were at least five times more common among confirmed cases with diabetes, high blood pressure or heart or breathing problems.All of these factors interact with each other and we don't yet have a complete picture of the risk for every type of person in every location.And even though patterns in the death rates among confirmed cases can tell us who is most at risk, they can't tell us about the precise risk in any single group.
The death rate in confirmed cases is not the overall death rate.Most cases of most viruses go uncounted because people tend not to visit the doctor with mild symptoms.On 17 March, the chief scientific adviser for the UK, Sir Patrick Vallance, estimated there were about 55,000 cases in the UK, when the confirmed case count was just under 2,000.Dividing deaths by 2,000 will give you a much higher death rate than dividing by 55,000.That's one of the biggest reasons why the death rates among confirmed cases are a bad estimate of the true death rates: overestimating the severity by missing cases.But you can also get it wrong in the other direction: underestimating the death rate by not taking into account those people currently infected who may eventually die.Why do death rates differ between countries?According to research by Imperial College, it's because different countries are better or worse at spotting the milder, harder to count cases.Countries use different tests for the virus, have different testing capacity and different rules for who gets tested. All of these factors change over time.
The UK government plans to increase testing to 10,000 a day initially, with a goal of reaching 25,000 a day within four weeks. It currently restricts testing mainly to people in hospitals.Germany has a daily testing capacity of more than 20,000 cases and has been testing people with mild symptoms.So their counts of confirmed infections could capture different sections of the pyramid of cases shown above.The death rate among confirmed cases in Germany (less than half a per cent) is among the lowest in Europe, but is expected to rise as the mix of patients getting tested changes.Your prognosis also depends on the treatment that's available and whether the health service can deliver it.In turn, that depends on the stage of the epidemic.If a healthcare system gets swamped with cases and intensive care units can't treat people who need ventilation, then the death rate would go up.How do scientists work out the true death rate?Scientists combine individual pieces of evidence about each of these questions to build a picture of the death rate.For example, they estimate the proportion of cases with mild symptoms from small, defined groups of people who are monitored very tightly, like those on repatriated flights.But slightly different answers from these targeted pieces of evidence will add up to big changes in the overall picture.And the evidence will change over time.Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, points out that death rates could go down as well as up.""With Ebola, they came down over time as people got better at treating the disease"" but they can go up too: ""If a healthcare system is overrun, then we see death rates rising"".So scientists give a an upper and a lower figure, as well as a best current estimate.",1
"The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19.
For most, the disease is mild, but some people die.So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated?Incubation period.This is when the virus is establishing itself.Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them.The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face.It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into ""coronavirus factories"" that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells.At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms.The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average.Mild disease.This is all most people will experience.Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough.Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed.The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines.These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever.The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus.
Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care.This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus.However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19.This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too.Severe disease.If the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus.Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body.""The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know,"" said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London.Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia.If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs.This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe.This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China.Critical disease.It is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill.By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death.The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body.It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely.Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive. It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines.""The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania said.And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage.
Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in.But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive.The first deaths.Doctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts.The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs.The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital.He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating.He died 11 days after he was admitted.The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome.He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed.

"More than one million people around the world are known to have recovered from coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University. But the road back to full health is not the same for everyone.Recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. Some people will shrug off the illness quickly, but for others it could leave lasting problems.Age, gender and other health issues all increase the risk of becoming more seriously ill from Covid-19.Are ethnic minorities being hit hardest by coronavirus?How does coronavirus affect children?Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50?The more invasive the treatment you receive, and the longer it is performed, the longer recovery is likely to take.What if I have only mild symptoms?Most people who get Covid-19 will develop only the main symptoms - a cough or fever. But they could experience body aches, fatigue, sore throat and headache.The cough is initially dry, but some people will eventually start coughing up mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and pain relief such as paracetamol.People with mild symptoms should make a good and speedy recovery.The fever should settle in less than a week, although the cough may linger. A World Health Organization (WHO) analysis of Chinese data says it takes two weeks on average to recover.What if I have more serious symptoms?The disease can become much more serious for some. This tends to happen about seven to 10 days into the infection.The transformation can be sudden. Breathing becomes difficult and the lungs get inflamed. This is because although the body's immune system is trying to fight back - it's actually overreacting and the body experiences collateral damage.Some people will need to be in hospital for oxygen therapy.GP Sarah Jarvis says: ""The shortness of breath may take some considerable time to improve... the body is getting over scarring and inflammation.""She says it could take two to eight weeks to recover, with tiredness lingering.What if I need intensive care?The WHO estimates one person in 20 will need intensive care treatment, which can include being sedated and put on a ventilator.It will take time to recover from any spell in an intensive or critical care unit (ICU), no matter what the illness. Patients are moved to a regular ward before going home.Dr Alison Pittard, Dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, says it can take 12 to 18 months to get back to normal after any spell in critical care.
Spending a long time in a hospital bed leads to muscle mass loss. Patients will be weak and muscle will take time to build up again. Some people will need physiotherapy to walk again.Because of what the body goes through in ICU, there's also the possibility of delirium and psychological disorders.
""There does seem to be an added element with this disease - viral fatigue is definitely a huge factor,"" says Paul Twose, critical care physiotherapist at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board.There have been reports from China and Italy of whole-body weakness, shortness of breath after any level of exertion, persistent coughing and irregular breathing. Plus needing a lot of sleep.""We do know patients take a considerable period, potentially months, to recover.""But it is hard to generalise. Some people spend relatively short periods in critical care, while others are ventilated for weeks.Will coronavirus affect my health long-term?We don't know for sure as there is no long-term data, but we can look at other conditions.Acute respiratory distress syndrome (called Ards) develops in patients whose immune systems go into overdrive, causing damage to the lungs.""There is really good data that, even five years down the line, people can have ongoing physical and psychological difficulties,"" says Mr Twose.Dr James Gill, a GP and lecturer at Warwick Medical School, says people also need mental health support to improve recovery.""You're finding breathing difficult, then the doctor says 'We need to put you on a ventilator. We need to put you to sleep. Do you want to say goodbye to your family?'.""PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] in these most severe patients is not unsurprising. There will be significant psychological scars for many.""There remains the possibility that even some mild cases may leave patients with long-term health problems - such as fatigue.How many people have recovered?Getting an accurate figure is difficult.As of 1 May, Johns Hopkins University reported more than 1,021,000 people had recovered out of 3.2 million people known to have been infected around the world.But countries use different recording methods. Some are not publishing recovery figures and many mild infections will be missed.Mathematical models have estimated between 99-99.5% of people recover.Can I catch Covid-19 again?There has been much speculation, but little evidence, on how durable any immunity is. If patients have successfully fought off the virus, they must have built up an immune response.Reports of patients being infected twice may just be down to tests incorrectly recording they were free of the virus.The immunity question is vital for understanding whether people can be reinfected and how effective any vaccine may be.

"We have gone weeks without seeing friends and family, without school, holidays or even being able to go to work.On 10 May, Boris Johnson is expected to address lockdown measures, although people should ""not expect big changes.""So what can be lifted and when?Why can't we just lift lockdown?This virus remains massively contagious. Before lockdown, one infected person passed it onto at least three others on average (the so called R-number).And less than 5% of the UK population is estimated to have been infected. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable.
If we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable.Is there any wiggle room?The goal of lockdown has been to cut infections by around 70% to force the R-number below one (the point at which the outbreak starts to decline). That has been achieved.However, it is only just below one.""There isn't much wiggle room,"" a source within the government's science advisers told me, adding the country ""can't make a huge number of changes"".One set of modelling suggests opening schools - and nothing else - would be enough to almost tip us back into rising cases.What will 'test, track, trace' achieve?The aim is to create more ""wiggle room"" - you identify cases and then perform rapid contact tracing and put those at risk in quarantine.This strategy, also called ""seek and destroy"", will be supported by a voluntary smartphone app which will help identify contacts.The more successfully this is done, the more it will reduce the ability of the virus to spread and the more restrictions can be lifted on day-to-day life.""At the moment you need, on average, a 60-70% reduction in social interactions to stop the outbreak increasing,"" said Dr Kucharski.""If we can get that down to 30% that gives you a lot more to play with.""But even this is not life as normal and other measures would still be needed to keep the disease in check.""It is a more moderate version of where we are now,"" said Dr Kucharski.What about protecting those at risk?Another strategy proposed by some is ""enhanced shielding"".Instead of trying to suppress the coronavirus across every section of society, you could instead aim to stop it completely for the most vulnerable.Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Very crudely, for 80% of us who are not vulnerable this is a nasty virus, but it wouldn't overwhelm the healthcare system and it wouldn't lock down society.""If we really bolster that shielding, make a very strong shield indeed, then it buys you a lot more room and it may mean you can relax some measures permanently.""That would mean all staff hospitals, care homes or anyone visiting those deemed vulnerable being regularly tested to ensure they are clear of the virus. Ideally, antibody tests would prove they are immune to it.The danger is, having more virus circulating in the community could put those ""shields"" under intense pressure.Which lockdown measures could be lifted?Some restrictions are less risky in terms of spreading the virus.""Essentially we've got a lot of not very good options - it won't be one day and everything will change, but things could open up,"" Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC.Dr Kucharski argues lifting different restrictions can be put into three broad categories: Those with low, moderate and substantial risk of increasing transmission of the virus.Low risk includes exercising outdoors, which has been restricted in some countries.Wales has already announced that from 11 May, people will be able able to exercise more than once a day.Moderate risk would include letting some non-essential shops re-open or having occasional gatherings with people outside the household.Substantial increases could come from lifting advice to work from home, reopening schools or isolating sick people and quarantining households.""I think the order things went in will be reflected in the order things will be lifted,"" he says.There remains a nervousness within the scientific advice to government about lifting restrictions in areas, like pubs, whose whole purpose is to bring people together.And there is an emerging question around primary schools as young children, some studies suggest, cannot be infected as easily.When could restrictions be lifted?
There is a decision about how far we go with suppressing the virus now we've passed the peak.We could drive levels down as low as possible. That will greatly limit the ability of the virus to bounce back in a second wave and make testing and contact tracing more likely to be effective. The trade-off is maintaining the lockdown for longer.Or we could exit lockdown now and accept having a higher number of cases, which creates its own problems.What could shift the balance?The biggest thing that could come along is a vaccine, as immunising people would mean there was no need for any social distancing measures. That is thought to be more than a year away.Failing that, the concept of herd immunity may kick in when around 70% of the population have been infected and the virus can no longer cause large outbreaks.Effective drugs would also make a huge difference if they could stop Covid-19 progressing from a cough or fever into a serious disease needing intensive care.We might get closer to normality, or at least normality for some, in the months to come. But we are all still in this for the long haul.",1
 coronavirus has a contagion factor of 2 and a cure rate of 99.7% for those under 50 it infects,0
"If you saw the 2011 movie “Contagion,” about a worldwide pandemic of a new virus, then you’ve heard the term “R0.”Pronounced “R naught,” this isn’t just jargon made up in Hollywood. It represents an important concept in epidemiology and is a crucial part of public health planning during an outbreak, like the current coronavirus pandemic that’s spread globally since it was first identified in China.Scientists use R0 – the reproduction number – to describe the intensity of an infectious disease outbreak. R0 estimates have been an important part of characterizing pandemics or large publicized outbreaks, including the 2003 SARS pandemic, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. It’s something epidemiologists are racing to nail down about SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.How much will a disease spread?The formal definition of a disease’s R0 is the number of cases, on average, an infected person will cause during their infectious period.The term is used in two different ways.The basic reproduction number represents the maximum epidemic potential of a pathogen. It describes what would happen if an infectious person were to enter a fully susceptible community, and therefore is an estimate based on an idealized scenario.The effective reproduction number depends on the population’s current susceptibility. This measure of transmission potential is likely lower than the basic reproduction number, based on factors like whether some of the people are vaccinated against the disease, or whether some people have immunity due to prior exposure with the pathogen. Therefore, the effective R0 changes over time and is an estimate based on a more realistic situation within the population.It’s important to realize that both the basic and effective R0 are situation-dependent. It’s affected by the properties of the pathogen, such as how infectious it is. It’s affected by the host population – for instance, how susceptible people are due to nutritional status or other illnesses that may compromise one’s immune system. And it’s affected by the environment, including things like demographics, socioeconomic and climatic factors.For example, R0 for measles ranges from 12 to 18, depending on factors like population density and life expectancy. This is a large R0, mainly because the measles virus is highly infectious.On the other hand, the influenza virus is less infectious, with its R0 ranging from 0.9 to 2.1. Influenza, therefore, does not cause the same explosive outbreaks as measles, but it persists due to its ability to mutate and evade the human immune system.What makes R0 useful in public health?Demographer Alfred Lotka proposed the reproduction number in the 1920s, as a measure of the rate of reproduction in a given population.In the 1950s, epidemiologist George MacDonald suggested using it to describe the transmission potential of malaria. He proposed that, if R0 is less than 1, the disease will die out in a population, because on average an infectious person will transmit to fewer than one other susceptible person. On the other hand, if R0 is greater than 1, the disease will spread.When public health agencies are figuring out how to deal with an outbreak, they are trying to bring R0 down to less than 1. This is tough for diseases like measles that have a high R0. It is especially challenging for measles in densely populated regions like India and China, where R0 is higher, compared to places where people are more spread out.For the SARS pandemic in 2003, scientists estimated the original R0 to be around 2.75. A month or two later, the effective R0 dropped below 1, thanks to the tremendous effort that went into intervention strategies, including isolation and quarantine activities.However, the pandemic continued. While on average, an infectious person transmitted to fewer than one susceptible individual, occasionally one person transmitted to tens or even hundreds of other cases. This phenomenon is called super spreading. Officials documented super spreader events a number of times during the SARS epidemic in Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing.R0 for coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. A number of groups have estimated R0 for this new coronavirus. The Imperial College group has estimated R0 to be somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5. Most modeling simulations that project future cases are using R0s in that range.These differences are not surprising; there’s uncertainty about many of the factors that go into estimating R0, such as in estimating the number of cases, especially early on in an outbreak.Based on these current estimates, projections of the future number of cases of coronavirus are fraught with high levels of uncertainty and will likely be somewhat inaccurate.The difficulties arise for a number of reasons.First, the basic properties of this viral pathogen – like the infectious period – are as yet unknown.Second, researchers don’t know how many mild cases or infections that don’t result in symptoms have been missed by surveillance but nevertheless are spreading the disease.Third, the majority of people who come down with this new coronavirus do recover, and are likely then immune to coming down with it again. It’s unclear how the changing susceptibility of the population will affect the future spread of infection. As the virus moves into new regions and communities, it encounters people with varying health conditions that affect their susceptibility to disease, as well as different social structures, both of which affect its transmissibility.Finally, and likely the most important reason, no one knows the future impacts of current disease control measures. Epidemiologists’ current estimates of R0 say nothing about how measures such as travel restrictions, social distancing and self-quarantine efforts will influence the virus’s continued spread.",1
"The Chinese were all given mandatory vaccines last fall. The vaccine contained replicating, digitized controllable RNA which were activated by 60Ghz mm 5G waves that were just turned on in Wuhan ( as well as all other countries using 60Ghz 5G with the smart dust that everyone on the globe has been inhaling through chemtrails. That's why when they say someone is cured, the virus can be digitally reactivated at any time and the person can literally drop dead. The diamond prince cruise was specifically equiped with 60Ghz 5G. It's basically remote assassination. Americans are currently breathing in this smart dust through chemtrails.

"The government of Shanghai, China has announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of intravenous vitamin C. (1) Dosage recommendations vary with severity of illness, from 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 200 mg/kg/day.
These dosages are approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mg for an adult, administered by IV. This specific method of administration is important, says intravenous therapy expert Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD, because vitamin C's effect is at least ten times more powerful by IV than if taken orally. Dr. Yanagisawa is president of the Tokyo-based Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy. He says, ""Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.""
Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, a Chinese-American specialist physician, has been working closely with medical and governmental authorities throughout China. He has been instrumental in facilitating at least three Chinese clinical IV vitamin C studies now underway. Dr. Cheng is presently in Shanghai continuing his efforts to encourage still more Chinese hospitals to implement vitamin C therapy incorporating high oral doses as well as C by IV.
Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa both recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19 infection.

"There is only one existing treatment for the new coronavirus: vitamin C.Vitamin C supports your immune system.Vitamin C helps to kill the virus and reduces the symptoms of infection.It's not a COVID ""cure,"" but nothing is.It might just save your life, though, and will definitely reduce the severity of the infection.If someone tells you it's not proven, consider two things:Nothing is proven to work against COVID-19, because it is a new virus.Vitamin C has worked against every single virus including influenzas, pneumonia, and even poliomyelitis.What to do.If you do nothing else, start taking vitamin C right away; at least 3 grams a day, spread right across the day. That's a 1,000 milligram capsule every 8 hours, or a level teaspoon of powder dissolved in a pint or so of water, drank all through the day.If you're smart and motivated, do all the other things recommended in our previous release Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus.When and if you catch a bug that might be COVID-19, simply increase your vitamin C intake: a rounded teaspoon (that's 4 to 5 grams) in water (which helps to keep you hydrated) every 3 or 4 hours. And keep on taking it.Do you consult a doctor? Do you self-isolate? Yes and yes. Of course you do; that's your duty to others.Vitamin C and the other measures are what you do for yourself.These links provide a large number of references to back up our above statements:",0
"We can all agree that 50 tons of vitamin C pretty much qualifies as a megadose.

News of nutrition-centered treatment of COVID-19 has been branded ""fake news"" and ""0 information."" I say that what is ""0"" and ""fake"" is the deliberate omission of any news of health-saving, life-saving measures already underway to help the people of China and the rest of our planet. .Here is more verified but still unreported news of high-dose intravenous vitamin C against COVID-19 in China:",0
"Intravenous vitamin C is already being employed in China against COVID-19 coronavirus. I am receiving regular updates because I am part of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Board to the International Intravenous Vitamin C China Epidemic Medical Support Team. Its director is Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD; associate director is Hong Zhang, PhD. Among other team members are Qi Chen, PhD (Associate Professor, Kansas University Medical School); Jeanne Drisko, MD (Professor, University of Kansas Medical School); Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD; and Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD. (Professor, Kyorin University, Tokyo). To read the treatment protocol information in English.Direct report from China. OMNS Chinese edition editor Dr. Richard Cheng is reporting from China about the first approved study of 12,000 to 24,000 mg/day of vitamin C by IV. The doctor also specifically calls for immediate use of vitamin C for prevention of coronavirus (COVID-19). A second clinical trial of intravenous vitamin C was announced in China on Feb. 13th. In this second study, says Dr. Cheng, ""They plan to give 6,000 mg/day and 12,000 mg/day per day for moderate and severe cases. We are also communicating with other hospitals about starting more intravenous vitamin C clinical studies. We would like to see oral vitamin C included in these studies, as the oral forms can be applied to more patients and at home."" Additional information.
And on Feb 21, 2020, announcement has been made of a third research trial now approved for intravenous vitamin C for COVID-19. Dr. Cheng, who is a US board-certified specialist in anti-aging medicine, adds: ""Vitamin C is very promising for prevention, and especially important to treat dying patients when there is no better treatment. Over 2,000 people have died of the COIV-19 outbreak and yet I have not seen or heard large dose intravenous vitamin C being used in any of the cases. The current sole focus on vaccine and specific antiviral drugs for epidemics is misplaced.""He adds that: ""Early and sufficiently large doses of intravenous vitamin C are critical. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant, but also involved in virus killing and prevention of viral replication. The significance of large dose intravenous vitamin C is not just at antiviral level. It is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that kills most people from coronaviral pandemics (SARS, MERS and now NCP). ARDS is a common final pathway leading to death.""We therefore call for a worldwide discussion and debate on this topic.""News of vitamin C research for COVID-19 is being actively suppressed. Anyone saying that vitamin therapy can stop coronavirus is already being labeled as ""promoting 0 information"" and promulgating ""fake news."" Even the sharing of verifiable news, and direct quotes from credentialed medical professionals, is being restricted or blocked on social media. You can see sequential examples of this phenomenon at my Facebook page.Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) has, literally, met with Google and Facebook and other media giants to stop the spread of what they declare to be wrong information.Physician-directed, hospital-based administration of intravenous vitamin C has been marginalized or discredited. Scientific debate over COVID-19 appears to not be allowed.Ironically, Facebook, blocking any significant users' sharing of the news of approved vitamin therapy research, is itself blocked in China by the Chinese government. As for the internet, yes, China has it. And yes, it is censored. But, significantly, the Chinese government has not blocked this real news on how intravenous vitamin C will save lives in the COVID-19 epidemic. Here is the protocol as published in Chinese.Medical orthodoxy obsessively focuses on searching for a vaccine and/or drug for coronavirus COVID-19). While they are looking for what would be fabulously profitable approaches, we have with vitamin C an existing, plausible, clinically demonstrated method to treat what coronavirus patients die from: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or pneumonia.And it is available right now.",0
"The 2019-nCov (coronavirus) epidemic originated in Wuhan, China and is now spreading to many other continents and countries, causing a public fear. Worst of all, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral drugs for 2019-nCov available. This adds to the public fear and gloomy outlook. A quick, rapidly deployable and accessible, effective and also safe treatment is urgently needed to not only save those patients, to curtail the spread of the epidemic, but also very important in the psychological assurance to people worldwide, and to the Chinese in particular. Acute organ failure, especially pulmonary failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) is the key mechanism for 2019-nCov's fatality. Significantly increased oxidative stress due to the rapid release of free radicals and cytokines etc. is the hallmark of ARDS which leads to cellular injury, organ failure and death. Early use of large dose antioxidants, especially vitamin C (VC), therefore, plays a key role in the management of these patients. We call upon all those in the leadership, and those providing direct assistance patients, to bravely and rapidly apply large dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) to help those patients and to stop this epidemic.2019-nCov is a rapidly developing epidemic with a high morbidity and mortality.Wang et al reports 26% ICU admission rate and a 4.3% mortality rate in their 138 confirmed cases. Chen et all report that out of 99 confirmed 2019-nCov patients, 17 (17%) patients developed ARDS and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.Increased oxidative stress, an underlying ""cytokine storm,"" leads to ARDS which is the key pathology of high mortality of these pandemic viral infections. Cytokine storm-induced ARDS is the key pathology leading to death of these patients. Intravenous vitamin C effectively counters oxidative stress.Cytokine storm
Coronaviruses and influenza are among the pandemic viruses that can cause lethal lung injuries and death from ARDS [3]. Viral infections cause a ""cytokine storm"" that can activate lung capillary endothelial cells leading to neutrophil infiltration and increased oxidative stress (reactive oxygen and nitrogen species) that further damages lung barrier function. ARDS, which is characterized by severe hypoxemia, is usually accompanied by uncontrolled inflammation, oxidative injury, and the damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier. The increased oxidative stress is a major insult in pulmonary injury such as acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), two clinical manifestations of acute respiratory failure with substantially high morbidity and mortality.
In a report of 29 patients confirmed of 2019-nCov pneumonia patients, 27 (93%) showed increased hsCRP, a marker of inflammation (and oxidative stress). Transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a major regulator of antioxidant response element- (ARE-) driven cytoprotective protein expression. The activation of Nrf2 signaling plays an essential role in preventing cells and tissues from injury induced by oxidative stress. Vitamin C is an essential element of the antioxidant system in cellular response. Part of vitamin C's biological effects in critical care management are well reviewed in a recent article by Nabzdyk and Bittner from Mass Gen Hospital of Harvard Medical School on World's Journal of Critical Care Medicine:Antioxidants, especially large dose IV vitamin C (IVC) in the management of ARDS.
It's clear that increased oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and death. Cytokine storm is observed in both viral and bacterial infections [3]. Cytokine storm leads to increased oxidative stress, ARDS and death seems to be a common and non-specific pathway. This is important in clinical management. Since the prevention and management targeting increased oxidative stress with large dose of antioxidants seems a logical step and can be applied to these deadly pandemics, without the lengthy waiting for pathogen-specific vaccines and drugs, as is the case of the current 2019-nCov epidemic.As a matter of fact, large dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) has been used clinically successfully in viral ARDS and also in influenza. Fowler et al described a 26-year-old woman developed viral ARDS (rhinovirus and enterovirus-D68). She was admitted to ICU. After failure to routine standard management, she was placed on ECMO on day 3. High dose IVC (200mg/kg body/24 hour, divided in 4 doses, one every 6 hours) was also started on ECMO day 1. Her lungs showed significant improvement on day 2 of high dose IVC infusion on X-ray imaging. She continued to improve on ECMO and IVC and ECMO was discontinued on ECMO day 7 and the patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital on hospital day 12, without the need of supplemental oxygen. One month later, X-ray of her lungs showed complete recovery. Gonzalez et al (including one of the authors, Thomas Levy) reported recently a severe case of influenza successfully treated with high dose IVC. 25-year-old MG developed flu-like symptoms which was rapidly deteriorating to the degree that, about 2 weeks later, the patient barely had the energy to use the toilet. He was placed on high dose IVC (50,000 mg of vitamin C in 1000 ml Ringer's solution, infused over 90 minutes). The patient immediately reported significant improvement the next day. On day 4 of IVC infusion he reported to feel normal. He continued oral VC (2,000 mg twice daily). Another story has been widely circulating on the social media that large dose IVC reportedly was used in 2009 to save a New Zealand farmer, Alan Smith (Primal Panacea). One of us (Thomas Levy) was consulted upon in this case. Hemila et al reported that vitamin C shortens ICU stay in their 2019 meta-analysis of 18 clinical studies with a total of 2004 ICU patients on the journal Nutrients [13]. In this report, 17,000 mg/day IVC shortened the ICU stay by 44%. Marik et al reported their use of IVC in 47 sepsis ICU cases. They found a significant reduction in mortality rate in the IVC group of patients.Dietary antioxidants (vitamin C and sulforaphane) were shown to reduce oxidative-stress-induced acute inflammatory lung injury in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Other antioxidants (curcumin) have also been shown to have promising anti-inflammatory potential in pneumonia.High dose IVC has been clinically used for several decades and a recent NIH expert panel document states clearly that high dose IVC (1.5 g/kd body weight) is safe and without major side effects.Summary.2019-nCov pneumonia is a rapidly developing disease with high morbidity and mortality rate. The key pathogenesis is the acute lung injury causing ARDS and death. Coronaviruses, influenza viruses and many other pandemic viral infections are usually associated with an increase oxidative stress leasing to oxidative cellular damage resulting in multi-organ failure. Antioxidants administration therefore has a central role in the management of these conditions, in addition to the standard conventional supportive therapies. Preliminary clinical studies and case reports show that early administration of high dose IVC can improve clinical conditions of patients in ICU, ARDS and flu. It needs to be pointed that pandemics like 2019-nCov will happen in the future. Specific vaccines and antiviral drugs R&D take long time to develop and are not available for the current nCov epidemic and won't be ready when the next pandemic strikes. IVC and other antioxidants are universal agents for ARDS that can be rapidly applied clinically. Given that high dose IVC is safe, can be effective, we call on the involved leadership and healthcare professionals to look into high dose IVC without further delay. More clinical studies of the IVC and oral VC (such as liposomal-encapsulated VC) are needed to develop standard protocols for the current use and future uses are urgently needed. We hope when the next pandemic strikes, we won't be so helpless and we'll be ready.",0
"China is conducting a clinical trial of 24,000 mg/day of intravenous vitamin C to treat patients with coronavirus and severe respiratory complications. Participants will receive IV vitamin C for 7 days straight at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Honor and thanks are due to Zhiyong Peng, MD, for making this happen. He is chief physician and professor at the hospital, which is close to ground zero for coronavirus. This important study was filed and announced yesterday and details may be confirmed.At Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, 24,000 mg of vitamin C will be administered to coronavirus patients, intravenously, each day for 7 days.To fight a dangerous virus for which there is no existing medical treatment, you must rely on your own immune system. It is well established, in every nutrition textbook ever written, that you need vitamin C to make your immune system work well, or to even work at all. Inadequate vitamin C intake is a worldwide problem that can be immediately and economically fixed. With even modest amounts of supplemental vitamin C, deaths will decrease. In one study, a mere 200 mg of vitamin C/day resulted in an 80% decrease in deaths among severely ill, hospitalized respiratory disease patients. Another recent study used this same low 200 mg dose for infants and children under five years of age, with severe pneumonia. The authors concluded that ""Vitamin C is effective in reducing duration of severe pneumonia in children less than five years of age. Oxygen saturation was improved in less than one day.
A lack of vitamin C has been long known, literally for decades, to increase susceptibility to viruses. It is one thing to be sick from a virus and another thing entirely to die from a viral-instigated disease. The greatest danger with coronavirus is escalation to pneumonia. For this, much higher doses of vitamin C are indicated, preferably by IV.How to administer high-dose intravenous vitamin C in hospital, Chinese language edition, is now posted for free access. This information is now being publicized all over Asia. Just because it is not on the American news channels doesn't mean it's not happening. It is. This is real news. The fake news is the media's neglect in not reporting it. And here is the protocol in English, to make reporting all the easier",0
"How Vitamin C Reduces Severity and Deaths from Serious Viral Respiratory Diseases. Most deaths from coronavirus are caused by pneumonia. Vitamin C has been known, for over 80 years, to greatly benefit pneumonia patients.In 1936 Gander and Niederberger found that vitamin C lowered fever and reduced pain in pneumonia patients.Also in 1936, Hochwald independently reported similar results. He gave 500 mg of vitamin C every ninety minutes.McCormick gave 1000 mg vitamin C intravenously, followed by 500 mg orally every hour. He repeated the injection at least once. On the fourth day, his patient felt so well that he voluntarily resumed work, with no adverse effects.In 1944 Slotkin and Fletcher reported on the prophylactic and therapeutic value of vitamin C in bronchopneumonia, lung abscess, and purulent bronchitis. ""Vitamin C has greatly alleviated this condition and promptly restored normal pulmonary function."" Slotkin further reported that ""Vitamin C has been used routinely by the general surgeons in the Millard Fillmore Hospital, Buffalo, as a prophylactic against pneumonia, with complete disappearance of this complication.""According to the US Centers for Disease Control, there are about 80,000 dead from annual influenzas, escalating to pneumonia, in the USA. Coronavirus is a very serious contagious disease. But contagion to a virus largely depends on the susceptibility of the host. It is well established that low vitamin C levels increase susceptibility to viruses.Vitamin C lowers mortality. It is one thing to be sick from a virus and another thing entirely to die from a viral-instigated disease. It must be emphasized that a mere 200 mg of vitamin C/day resulted in an 80% decrease in deaths among severely ill, hospitalized respiratory disease patients.A single, cheap, big-box discount store vitamin C tablet will provide more than twice the amount used in the study above.And yes, with vitamin C, more is better.Frederick R. Klenner and Robert F. Cathcart successfully treated influenza and pneumonia with very high doses of vitamin C. Klenner published on his results beginning in the 1940s; Cathcart beginning in the 1970s.They used both oral and intravenous administration.""Vitamin C is effective in reducing duration of severe pneumonia in children less than five years of age. Oxygen saturation was improved in less than one day.""
A recent placebo controlled study concluded that ""vitamin C should be included in treatment protocol of children with pneumonia so that mortality and morbidity can be reduced."" In this study, the majority of the children were infants under one year of age. By body weight, the modest 200 mg dose given, to tiny babies, would actually be the equivalent of 2,000-3,000 mg/day for an adult.Although many will rightly maintain that the dose should be high, even a low supplemental amount of vitamin C saves lives. This is very important for those with low incomes and few treatment options.We're talking about twenty cents' worth of vitamin C a day to save lives now.",0
"No matter which hospital a coronavirus patient may seek help from, the question is, Will they be able to leave walking out the front door, or end up being wheeled out the basement backdoor? Prompt administration of intravenous vitamin C, in high doses, can make the difference.Abundant clinical evidence confirms vitamin C's effectiveness when used in sufficient quantity.Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades.Specific instructions for intravenous vitamin C. The Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy (JCIT) recommends intravenous vitamin C (IVC) 12.5/25g (12,500 - 25,000 mg) for acute viral infections (influenza, herpes zoster, common cold, rubella, mumps, etc.) and virus mimetic infections (idiopathic sudden hearing loss, Bell's palsy). In adults, IVC 12.5g is given for early stage illness with mild symptoms, and IVC 25g for moderate to severe symptoms. IVC is usually administered once or twice a day for 2-5 continuous days, along with or without general treatments for viral infections.Patients with acute viral infections show a depletion of vitamin C and increasing free radicals and cellular dysfunction. Such patients should be treated with vitamin C, oral or IV, for neutralizing free radicals throughout the body and inside cells, maintaining physiological functions, and enhancing natural healing. If patients progress to sepsis, vitamin C should be added intravenously as soon as possible along with conventional therapy for sepsis.Toronto Star, 30 May 2003: ""Fred Hui, MD believes that administering vitamin C intravenously is a treatment worth trying. And he'd like to see people admitted to hospital for the pneumonia-like virus treated with the vitamin intravenously while also receiving the usual drugs for SARS. 'I appeal to hospitals to try this for people who already have SARS,' says Hui. Members of the public would also do well to build up their levels of vitamin C, he says, adding that there is nothing to lose in trying it. 'This is one of the most harmless substances there is,' Hui states. 'There used to be concern about kidney stones, but that was theoretical. It was never borne out in an actual case.' Hui says he has found intravenous vitamin C effective in his medical practice with patients who have viral illnesses.""
Additional administration details are readily obtained from a free download of the complete Riordan Clinic Intravenous Vitamin C Protocol. Although initially prepared for cancer patients, the protocol has found widespread application for many other diseases, particularly viral illnesses.""Research and experience has shown that a therapeutic goal of reaching a peak-plasma concentration of ~20 mM (350- 400 mg/dL) is most efficacious. (No increased toxicity for posoxidant IVC plasma vitamin C levels up to 780 mg/dL has been observed.).The administering physician begins with a series of three consecutive IVC infusions at the 15, 25, and 50 gram dosages followed by post IVC plasma vitamin C levels in order to determine the oxidative burden for that patient so that subsequent IVCs can be optimally dosed.""There are four pages of supporting references.""Given the rapid rate of success of intravenous vitamin C in viral diseases, I strongly believe it would be my first recommendation in the management of corona virus infections.""Puerto Rico. ""It is of great importance for all doctors to be informed about intravenous vitamin C. When a patient is already in hospital severely ill, this would be the best solution to help save her or his life.""Winning the hospital game. When faced with hospitalization, the most powerful person in the most entire hospital system is the patient. However, in most cases, the system works on the assumption that the patient will not claim that power. If on your way in you signed the hospital's legal consent form, you can unsign it. You can revoke your permission. Just because somebody has permission to do one thing doesn't mean that they have the permission to do everything. There's no such thing as a situation that you cannot reverse. You can change your mind about your own personal healthcare. It concerns your very life. The rights of the patient override the rules of any institution.If the patient doesn't know that, or if they're not conscious, or if they just don't have the moxie to do it, the next most powerful person is the spouse. The spouse has enormous influence and can do almost as much as the patient. If the patient is incapacitated, the spouse can, and must, do all the more. If there is no spouse present, the next most powerful people in the system are the children of the patient.When you go to the hospital, bring along a big red pen, and cross out anything that you don't like in the hospital's permission form. And before you sign it, add anything you want. Write out ""I want intravenous vitamin C, 25 grams per day, until I state otherwise."" And should they say, ""We're not going to admit you,"" you reply, ""Please put it in writing that you refuse to admit me."" What do you think their lawyers are going to do with that? They have to admit you. It's a game, and you can win it. But you can't win it if you don't know the rules. And basically, they don't tell you the rules.This is deadly serious. Medical mistakes are now the third leading cause of death in the US. Yes, medical errors kill over 400,000 Americans every year. That's 1,100 each day, every day.There are mistakes of commission and mistakes of omission. Failure to provide intravenous vitamin C is, literally, a grave omission. Do not allow yourself or your loved ones to be deprived of a simple, easy to prepare and administer IV of vitamin C.""If a family member of mine died due to coronavirus infection, after a doctor refused to use intravenous vitamin C, I would challenge his or her treatment in a court of law. I would win.""It can be done. Vitamin IVs can be arranged in virtually any hospital, anywhere in the world. Attorney and cardiologist Thomas E. Levy's very relevant presentation is free access. Both the letter and the intent of new USA legislation now make this easier for you.""The new federal Right to Try Act provides patients suffering from life-threatening diseases or conditions the right to use investigational drugs... It amends the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt investigational drugs provided to patients who have exhausted approved treatment options and are unable to participate in a clinical trial involving the drug. Advocates of right to try laws have sought to accelerate access to new drugs for terminally ill patients who are running out of options. Arguably, the law does not represent a radical change in this and several other states, however, because in 2016, California had already joined the majority of other states in adopting a law enabling physicians to help terminally ill patients pursue investigational therapies, without fear of Medical Board or state civil or criminal liability. . . The new Right to Try law should give physicians, as well as drug manufacturers, some added comfort about FDA enforcement in these cases.""
Therefore, in regards to intravenous vitamin C, do not accept stories that ""the hospital can't"" or ""the doctor can't"" or that ""the state won't allow it."" If you hear any of this malarkey, please send the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service the text of the policy or the law that says so. In the meantime, take the reins and get vitamin C in the veins.",0
"Abundant clinical evidence confirms vitamin C's powerful antiviral effect when used in sufficient quantity. Treating influenza with very large amounts of vitamin C is not a new idea at all. Frederick R. Klenner, MD, and Robert F. Cathcart, MD, successfully used this approach for decades. Frequent oral dosing with vitamin C sufficient to reach a daily bowel tolerance limit will work for most persons. Intravenous vitamin C is indicated for the most serious cases.Bowel tolerance levels of vitamin C, taken as divided doses all throughout the day, are a clinically proven antiviral without equal. Vitamin C can be used alone or right along with medicines if one so chooses.""Some physicians would stand by and see their patients die rather than use ascorbic acid. Vitamin C should be given to the patient while the doctors ponder the diagnosis."" (Frederick R. Klenner, MD, chest specialist).Dr. Robert Cathcart advocated treating influenza with up to 150,000 milligrams of vitamin C daily, often intravenously. You and I can, to some extent, simulate a 24 hour IV of vitamin C by taking it by mouth very, very often. When I had pneumonia, it took 2,000 mg of vitamin C every six minutes, by the clock, to get me to saturation. My oral daily dose was over 100,000 mg. Fever, cough and other symptoms were reduced in hours; complete recovery took just a few days. That is performance at least as good as any pharmaceutical will give, and the vitamin is both safer and cheaper. Many physicians consider high doses of vitamin C to be so powerful an antiviral that it may be ranked as a functional immunization for a variety influenza strains.Dr. Cathcart writes:""The sicker a person was, the more ascorbic acid they would tolerate orally without it causing diarrhea. In a person with an otherwise normal GI tract when they were well, would tolerate 5 to 15 grams of ascorbic acid orally in divided doses without diarrhea. With a mild cold 30 to 60 grams; with a bad cold, 100 grams; with a flu, 150 grams; and with mononucleosis, viral pneumonia, etc. 200 grams or more of ascorbic acid would be tolerated orally without diarrhea. The process of finding what dose will cause diarrhea and will eliminate the acute symptoms, I call titrating to bowel tolerance.""The ascorbate effect is a threshold effect. Symptoms are usually neutralized when a dose of about 90% or more of bowel tolerance is reached with oral ascorbic acid. Intravenous sodium ascorbate is about 2½ times more powerful than ascorbic acid by mouth and since for all practical purposes huge doses of sodium ascorbate are non-toxic, whatever dose necessary to eliminate free radical driven symptoms should be given.""The coronavirus, in acute infections, may be expected to be just as susceptible to vitamin C as all of the other viruses against which it has been proven to be extremely effective. There has never been a documented situation in which sufficiently high dosing with vitamin C has been unable to neutralize or kill any virus against which it has been tested.Even the common cold is a coronavirus. A ""new"" opportunistic virus is a not a big surprise. History is full of them.Flu Pandemic of 1919-1920. About 10 million soldiers were killed in World War I (1914-1918), charging machine guns and getting mowed down month after month. There were nearly a million casualties at the Somme and another million at Verdun. A terrible slaughter went on for four years. Yet, in just the two years following the war, over 20 million people died from influenza. That is more than twice as many deaths from the flu in one-half the time it took the machine guns.With a century's worth of accumulated scientific hindsight, we must today ask this: Was a lack of vaccinations really the cause of those flu deaths, or was it really wartime stress, and especially war-induced malnutrition, that set the stage in 1918? And now, once again, we have an alarming and rather similar scenario: between nutrient-poor processed convenience foods, McNothing meals and TV news scare stories, we have the basic ingredients for an epidemic.
Influenza is a serious disease, and historically, has been the Reaper's scythe. There is no way to make light of that. It warrants a closer look at how the medical profession and government have approached different types of influenza.In the mid-1970s, there was the colossal Swine Flu panic. Here is what the government of the United States said about the infamous Swine Flu vaccine, in a 1976 mass-distributed FDA Consumer Memo on the subject:""Some minor side effects - tenderness in the arm, low fever, tiredness - will occur in less than 4% of (vaccinated) adults. Serious reactions from flu vaccines are very rare.""Many will remember the very numerous and very serious side effects of Swine Flu vaccine that forced the federal immunization program to a halt. So much for blanket claims of safety.As far as being essential, in the same memo the FDA said this of the same vaccine:""Question: What can be done to prevent an epidemic? Answer: The only preventive action we can take is to develop a vaccine to immunize the public against the virus. This will prevent the virus from spreading.""This was seen to be totally 0. The public immunization program for Swine Flu was abruptly halted and still there was no epidemic. If vaccination were the only defense, one might expect that tens of millions of Americans would have been struck down with the Swine Flu, for a large percentage of the population of the U.S. was not vaccinated.""Vaccines are being used as an ideological weapon. What you see every year as the flu is caused by 200 or 300 different agents with a vaccine against two of them. That is simply nonsense."" (Tom Jefferson, MD, epidemiologist).Robert F. Cathcart, MD, writes: ""Treatment of the Bird Flu with massive doses of ascorbate would be the same as any other flu except that the severity of the disease indicates that it may take unusually massive doses of ascorbic acid orally or even intravenous sodium ascorbate. (Why the dose needed is somewhat proportional to the severity of the disease being treated is discussed in my paper published in 1981, Titrating to Bowel Tolerance, Anascorbemia, and Acute Induced Scurvy.) I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C but it is possible that the bird flu may require even higher doses such as 150 to 300 grams a day. Additionally, this flu could be primarily respiratory. This means that hospitalization might be necessary. If massive doses of ascorbate are not used, they may not be adequate. Most hospitals will not allow adequate doses of ascorbate to be given.
""Initial oral doses of ascorbic acid should also be massive. I would suggest like 12 grams every 15 minutes until diarrhea is produced. Then, however, doses should be reduced but not much. Listen to your body. If there are many symptoms, keep taking doses that cause a little diarrhea. You do not want constant runs because it is the amount you absorb that is important, not the amount you put in your mouth.""BBC - 9 April 2006: ""The chances of bird flu virus mutating into a form that spreads between humans are 'very low,' the government's chief scientific adviser has said. Sir David King said any suggestion a global flu pandemic in humans was inevitable was 'totally misleading.'""The coronavirus outbreak in China seems to be due to a virus similar to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which was also a coronavirus. You may remember SARS from 2002. I most certainly do, as I was in Toronto, Canada at the time, smack in the middle of it. I took a lot of vitamin C preventively and had zero symptoms.""The common cold is a coronavirus, and SARS is a coronavirus, so they are the same viral type."" (David Jenkins, MD, Professor of Medicine and Nutritional Science, University of Toronto). Waiting for a vaccine?""We have set up a situation where a fear is created, and then we try to create the treatment for this fear. The public gets the idea that the flu is going to kill them and the vaccine will save them. Neither is true."" (Marc Siegel, MD, author of 0 Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of Fear). Robert F. Cathcart: ""All this talk about a vaccine is too late; a waste of time now, especially when we know how to cure the disease already. Every flu I have seen so far (since 1970) has been cured or ameliorated by massive doses of ascorbate. All of these diseases kill by way of free radicals. These free radicals are easily eliminated by massive doses of ascorbate. This is a matter of chemistry, not medicine. The time has come to stop hiding our ability to treat these acute infectious diseases with massive doses of ascorbate.""Ideally, however, in serious cases this disease should be treated first with at least 180 grams or more of sodium ascorbate intravenously every 24 hours running constantly until the fever is broken and most of the symptoms are ameliorated. If after a few hours that rate of administration does not have an obvious ameliorating effect, the rate should be increased.""What dosage?Vitamin C fights all types of viruses. Although the dose should truly be high, even a low supplemental amount of vitamin C saves lives. This is very important for those with low incomes and few treatment options. For example, in one well-controlled, randomized study, just 200 mg/day vitamin C given to the elderly resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms in the most severely ill, hospitalized patients. And there were 80% fewer deaths in the vitamin C group.
But to best build up our immune systems, we need to employ large, orthomolecular doses of several vital nutrients. The physicians on the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service review board specifically recommend at least 3,000 milligrams (or more) of vitamin C daily, in divided doses. Vitamin C empowers the immune system and can directly denature many viruses. It can be taken as ascorbic acid (which is sour like vinegar), either in capsules or as crystals dissolved in water or juice. It can also be taken as sodium ascorbate, which is non-acidic. To be most effective, it should be taken to bowel tolerance. This means taking high doses several (or many) times each day. See the references below for more information.Nebulized hydrogen peroxide. Thomas E. Levy, MD: ""Viral syndromes start or are strongly supported by ongoing viral replication in the naso- and oropharynx. When appropriate agents are nebulized (into a fine spray) and this viral presence is quickly eliminated, the rest of the body ""mops up"" quite nicely the rest of the viral presence. The worst viral infections are continually fed and sustained by the viral growth in the pharynx. Probably the best and most accessible agent to nebulize would be 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 to 30 minutes several times daily.""An example of successful treatment by ascorbate:""Chikungunya is a viral illness characterized by severe joint pains, which may persist for months to years. There is no effective treatment for this disease. We treated 56 patients with moderate to severe persistent pains with a single infusion of ascorbic acid ranging from 25-50 grams and hydrogen peroxide (3 cc of a 3% solution) from July to October 2014. Patients were asked about their pain using the Verbal Numerical Rating Scale-11 immediately before and after treatment. The mean Pain Score before and after treatment was 8 and 2 respectively (60%) (p < 0.001); and 5 patients (9%) had a Pain Score of 0. The use of intravenous ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide resulted in a statistically significant reduction of pain in patients with moderate to severe pain from the Chikungunya virus immediately after treatment.""Available evidence indicates that supplementation with multiple micronutrients with immune-supporting roles may modulate immune function and reduce the risk of infection. Micronutrients with the strongest evidence for immune support are vitamins C and D and zinc.Additional recommended nutrients. Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form). Many people are deficient in magnesium, because modern agriculture often does not supply adequate magnesium in the soil, and food processing removes magnesium. It is an extremely important nutrient that is essential for hundreds of biochemical pathways. A blood test for magnesium cannot correctly diagnose a deficiency. A long-term deficiency of magnesium can build up in the body that may take 6 months to a year of higher than normal doses to replete.A very cheap and highly beneficial adjunct for any acute infection, especially viral, is oral magnesium chloride. Amazingly, just as intravenous vitamin C has been shown to cure polio, an oral magnesium chloride regimen has been shown to do the same thing, as or even more effectively than the vitamin C.
Mix 25 grams MgCl2 in a quart of water. Depending on body size (tiny infant to an adult), give 15 to 125 ml of this solution four times daily. If the taste is too salty/bitter, a favorite juice can be added.Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. (Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000). Vitamin D is stored in the body for long periods but takes a long time to reach an effective level. If you are deficient (e.g. if you haven't taken vitamin D and it's near the end of winter when the sun is low in the sky) you can start by taking larger than normal doses for 2 weeks to build up the level quickly. The maintenance dose varies with body weight, 400-1000 IU/day for children and 2000-5000 IU/day for adults.William Grant, PhD, says: ""Coronaviruses cause pneumonia as does influenza. A study of the case-fatality rate from the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States showed that most deaths were due to pneumonia. The SARS-coronavirus and the current China coronavirus were both most common in winter, when vitamin D status is lowest.""""I have found the value of bolstering immune function with Vitamin D to be incredibly powerful."" Zinc is a powerful antioxidant and is essential for many biochemical pathways. It has been shown to be effective in helping the body fight infections. [20,21] A recommended dose is 20-40 mg/day for adults.Selenium: 100 mcg (micrograms) daily. Selenium is an essential nutrient and an important antioxidant that can help to fight infections. Dr. Damien Downing says: ""Swine flu, bird flu and SARS (another coronavirus) all developed in selenium-deficient areas of China; Ebola and HIV in Selenium-deficient areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. This is because the same oxidative stress that causes us inflammation forces viruses to mutate rapidly in order to survive. 'When Se-deficient virus-infected hosts were supplemented with dietary Se, viral mutation rates diminished and immunocompetence improved.'""B-complex vitamins and vitamin A: A multivitamin tablet with each meal will supply these conveniently and economically.Nutritional supplements are not just a good idea. For fighting viruses, they are absolutely essential.",0
"The coronavirus pandemic can be dramatically slowed, or stopped, with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C. Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular.It is very important to maximize the body's anti-oxidative capacity and natural immunity to prevent and minimize symptoms when a virus attacks the human body. The host environment is crucial. Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness. But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.""I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.""The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight:Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams (or more) daily, in divided doses.Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. (Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000). Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form).Zinc: 20 mg daily. Selenium: 100 mcg (micrograms) daily. Vitamin C, Vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, and selenium have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.The basis for using high doses of vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to vitamin C's early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940s.Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this. Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980.It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory infections with large amounts of vitamin C is well established. Those who believe that vitamin C generally has merit, but massive doses are ineffective or somehow harmful, will do well to read the original papers for themselves. To dismiss the work of these doctors simply because they had success so long ago sidesteps a more important question: Why has the benefit of their clinical experience not been presented to the public by responsible governmental authorities, especially in the face of a viral pandemic?",0

"Just over three months ago, a “high-level pandemic exercise” entitled “Event 201” was held in New York City.  On October 18th the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in conjunction with the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, brought together “15 leaders of business, government, and public health” to simulate a scenario in which a coronavirus pandemic was ravaging the planet.  The current coronavirus outbreak that originated in China did not begin until December, and so at that time it was supposedly just a hypothetical exercise.  The following comes from the official page for this event.
The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. The exercise illustrated areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences.I find it quite interesting that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was involved, because they are also financial backers of the institute that was granted a U.S. patent for “an attenuated coronavirus” in November 2018.
It appears that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has been quite interested in the threat posed by coronaviruses for quite some time.Eric Toner, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, spearheaded putting “Event 201” together.  In his scenario, a coronavirus outbreak had begun on Brazil’s pig farms.Toner’s simulation imagined a fictional virus called CAPS. The analysis, part of a collaboration with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, looked at what would happen if a pandemic originated in Brazil’s pig farms.Even though the outbreak was quite limited at first, Toner’s scenario ultimately showed that a coronavirus pandemic could kill 65 million people.The pretend outbreak started small: Farmers began coming down with symptoms that resembled the flu or pneumonia. From there, the virus spread to crowded and impoverished urban neighborhoods in South America.Flights were canceled, and travel bookings dipped by 45%. People disseminated 0 information on social media.After six months, the virus had spread around the globe. A year later, it had killed 65 million people.Let us certainly hope that this current outbreak does not evolve into that sort of a nightmare.According to Reuters, there are now more than 800 confirmed cases, and the death toll has shot up to 25.China confirmed 830 cases of patients infected with the new coronavirus as of Jan. 23, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 25, the National Health Commission said on Friday.But many are skeptical that the official figures are accurate.  Because the images coming out of Wuhan are extremely alarming.Disturbing images of Wuhan residents dropping unresponsive to the floor have emerged on Instagram following the diseased Chinese city’s coronavirus lockdown.
Wuhan has been branded a “zombieland” by frantic locals after Chinese authorities told residents they are not allowed to leave yesterday morning.
Pictures from inside the city paint an apocalyptic picture as medics patrol in hazmat suits and gas masks.Over the past 48 hours, numerous videos have been posted on social media that supposedly show violently sick people that have literally collapsed in the streets of Wuhan.  Here is just one example.And in another video, hundreds of mask-wearing Chinese citizens are crammed into the hallways of a hospital in Wuhan as they wait to see a doctor.This is something that I wrote about yesterday, and even though I documented my claims, I don’t think that a lot of people believed me.
In fact, when I told my wife what was happening at the hospitals even she didn’t believe me at first.But this is actually happening, and one video from a Wuhan hospital even shows a patient that collapsed on the ground as he waited to see a doctor.Chinese authorities are trying to keep everyone calm, but they are definitely treating this like it is no ordinary outbreak.  For example, one airline passenger that was suspected of having the virus was actually “wheeled out of an airport in a quarantine box”.Footage has emerged showing an airline passenger with suspected SARS-like coronavirus being wheeled out of an airport in a quarantine box.The man inside the box is wearing a protective suit, a mask and gloves after he reportedly showed possible symptoms, including a fever, during screening and was isolated from other travellers.The box is surrounded by staff wearing blue masks as it is wheeled to a waiting ambulance outside a terminal at the airport in Fuzhou in south-eastern China.The whole world was stunned when it was announced that the entire city of Wuhan would be facing a quarantine, but now seven other Chinese cities are also being locked down.In addition, big cities all over China are canceling festivities for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. Major Chinese cities, including Beijing and quarantine-blocked Wuhan, banned all large gatherings over the coming Lunar New Year festival, the most important holiday on the Chinese calendar, in an expanding effort to contain a rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak.The announcement Thursday came as authorities expanded travel restrictions imposed on Wuhan to surrounding municipalities, shutting down travel networks and attempting to quarantine about 25 million people – more than the population of Florida.We have never seen anything like this before in the entire modern history of China.Would Chinese officials really take such dramatic measures if the threat was not real?Of course here in the United States the CDC is assuring us that we don’t have anything to be concerned about. “We don’t want the American public to be worried about this because their risk is low,” says Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “On the other hand, we are taking this very seriously and are dealing very closely with Chinese authorities.”Hopefully they are correct, and hopefully this outbreak will blow over sooner rather than later.But a virologist that played a key role in identifying SARS in 2003 insists that what we have seen so far is just the beginning.“A bigger outbreak is certain,” said Guan Yi, a virologist who helped identify severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. He estimated – “conservatively,” he said – that this outbreak could be 10 times bigger than the SARS epidemic because that virus was transmitted by only a few “super spreaders” in a more defined part of the country.“We have passed through the ‘golden period’ for prevention and control,” he told Caixin magazine from self-imposed quarantine after visiting Wuhan. “What’s more, we’ve got the holiday traffic rush and a dereliction of duty from certain officials.”And if that wasn’t enough to send a chill down your spine, just check out what else he had to say. “I’ve seen it all: bird flu, SARS, influenza A, swine fever and the rest. But the Wuhan pneumonia makes me feel extremely powerless,” he told Caixin. “Most of the past epidemics were controllable, but this time, I’m petrified.”The next week or two will be an absolutely critical time.If authorities are able to stop the number of cases from rising at an exponential rate, and if there are able to keep it mostly confined to just a few areas of China, we may have a chance to prevent a global pandemic.But if not, we may be facing a worst case scenario.And according to “Event 201”, a worst case scenario could potentially mean tens of millions of dead people.",0
"In October 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security hosted a pandemic tabletop exercise called Event 201 with partners, the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Recently, the Center for Health Security has received questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction. Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic. We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people. Although our tabletop exercise included a mock novel coronavirus, the inputs we used for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not similar to nCoV-2019.",1
"But according to one simulation run less than three months ago, things could get much, much worse. Less than three months ago, Eric Toner, a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, had run a simulation of a global pandemic involving the exact same type of virus, according to Business Insider. 
His simulation predicted that 65 million people could die ""within 18 months"". He commented:“I have thought for a long time that the most likely virus that might cause a new pandemic would be a coronavirus.”As of now, the outbreak is not a pandemic, but it has been reported in eight different countries. Toner's simulation said that nearly ""every country in the world"" would have the virus after six months.He commented:“We don’t yet know how contagious it is. We know that it is being spread person to person, but we don’t know to what extent. An initial first impression is that this is significantly milder than SARS. So that’s reassuring. On the other hand, it may be more transmissible than SARS, at least in the community setting.”His analysis used a fictional virus called CAPS, which would be resistant to any modern vaccine and would be deadlier than SARS. The simulation involved a virus originating in Brazil's pig farms. The outbreak started small, with farmers coming down with symptoms, before spreading to crowded and impoverished areas. The simulation also showed flights being cancelled and travel bookings falling by 45%, as people disseminated 0 information on social media. It also triggered a financial crisis around the globe, with global GDP falling 11% and stock markets falling 20% to 40%. No word on whether or not the simulation accounted for the modern monetary theory the Fed is essentially governing with now. He also claimed that the current coronavirus could have major economic impact if it the total cases hits the thousands.He concluded:“If we could make it so that we could have a vaccine within months rather than years or decades, that would be a game changer. But it’s not just the identification of potential vaccines. We need to think even more about how they are manufactured on a global scale and distributed and administered to people.”
“It’s part of the world we live in now. We’re in an age of epidemics.”Of course here in the United States the CDC is assuring us that we don’t have anything to be concerned about. “We don’t want the American public to be worried about this because their risk is low,” says Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “On the other hand, we are taking this very seriously and are dealing very closely with Chinese authorities.”Hopefully they are correct, and hopefully this outbreak will blow over sooner rather than later.",0
"The coronavirus ""may never go away"", the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.Speaking at a briefing on Wednesday, WHO emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan warned against trying to predict when the virus would disappear.He added that even if a vaccine is found, controlling the virus will require a ""massive effort"".Almost 300,000 people worldwide are reported to have died with coronavirus, and more than 4.3m cases recorded.The UN meanwhile warned the pandemic was causing widespread distress and mental ill health - particularly in countries where there's a lack of investment in mental healthcare.The UN urged governments to make mental health considerations part of their overall response.What did WHO say?""It is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,"" Dr Ryan told the virtual press conference from Geneva.""HIV has not gone away - but we have come to terms with the virus.""Dr Ryan then said he doesn't believe ""anyone can predict when this disease will disappear"".There are currently more than 100 potential vaccines in development - but Dr Ryan noted there are other illnesses, such as measles, that still haven't been eliminated despite there being vaccines for them.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stressed it was still possible to control the virus, with effort.""The trajectory is in our hands, and it's everybody's business, and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic,"" he said.WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove also told the briefing: ""We need to get into the mindset that it is going to take some time to come out of this pandemic.""Their stark remarks come as several countries began to gradually ease lockdown measures, and leaders consider the issue of how and when to reopen their economies.Dr Tedros warned that there was no guaranteed way of easing restrictions without triggering a second wave of infections.""Many countries would like to get out of the different measures,"" the WHO boss said. ""But our recommendation is still the alert at any country should be at the highest level possible.""Dr Ryan added: ""There is some magical thinking going on that lockdowns work perfectly and that unlocking lockdowns will go great. Both are fraught with dangers.""",1
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease expert, said Sunday that the novel coronavirus could likely become ""seasonal"" as he emphasized the possibility of a resurgence in the outbreak later this year.Fauci said on CBS's ""Face The Nation"" that even if the global number of cases shrinks to a significantly low number, the difficulty in containing the outbreak means it is ""unlikely to be completely eradicated from the planet,"" and the next season could see a second rise of the outbreak.In that case, Fauci said the federal government is ""pushing so hard"" to improve its preparedness, including developing a vaccine and completing ""clinical trials on therapeutic interventions.""""Hopefully, if in fact we do see that resurgence, we will have interventions that we did not have in the beginning of the situation that we're in right now,"" he said.Fauci previously said that the earliest the US could get a coronavirus vaccine would be in 12 to 18 months, an impressive timeline for a vaccine, as fundraisers like Bill Gates rushed to support early-stage candidates.There are currently at least 40 vaccines for the novel coronavirus in development according to the World Health Organization, some of which have advanced to conducting human trials.The infectious disease expert also said Sunday that it would be ""a 0 statement"" to say the US government has the outbreak ""under control,"" despite President Donald Trump's regular reassurances on behalf of his administration.The US is currently the global epicenter for the pandemic, with more than 324,000 cases and at least 9,100 deaths.",1

"President Trump just announced that the ‘biological’ lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus was created was ‘funded’ by President Barak (sp) Hussein Obama in 2015 to the tune of $3,800,000 American dollars! This fact directly links Obama to all 150,000 deaths around the world!",0
"At an emergency meeting in Beijing held last Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke about the need to contain the coronavirus and set up a system to prevent similar epidemics in the future.A national system to control biosecurity risks must be put in place “to protect the people’s health,” Xi said, because lab safety is a “national security” issue.Xi didn’t actually admit that the coronavirus now devastating large swathes of China had escaped from one of the country’s bioresearch labs. But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is exactly what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive entitled: “Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.”
Read that again. It sure sounds like China has a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong, doesn’t it? And just how many “microbiology labs” are there in China that handle “advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus”?It turns out that in all of China there is only one. And this one is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be . . . the epicenter of the epidemic.That’s right. China’s only Level 4 microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, called the National Biosafety Laboratory, is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.What’s more, the People’s Liberation Army’s top expert in biological warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.According to the PLA Daily, Gen. Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax. This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.
Does that suggest to you that the novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, may have escaped from that very lab, and that Gen. Chen’s job is to try and put the genie back in the bottle, as it were? It does to me.Add to this China’s history of similar incidents. Even the deadly SARS virus has escaped — twice — from the Beijing lab where it was — and probably is — being used in experiments. Both “man-made” epidemics were quickly contained, but neither would have happened at all if proper safety precautions had been taken.
And then there is this little-known fact: Some Chinese researchers are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them.You heard me right.Instead of properly disposing of infected animals by cremation, as the law requires, they sell them on the side to make a little extra cash. Or, in some cases, a lot of extra cash. One Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound up in someone’s stomach.Also fueling suspicions about SARS-CoV-2’s origins is the series of increasingly lame excuses offered by the Chinese authorities as people began to sicken and die.They first blamed a seafood market not far from the Institute of Virology, even though the first documented cases of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) involved people who had never set foot there. Then they pointed to snakes, bats and even a cute little scaly anteater called a pangolin as the source of the virus.
I don’t buy any of this. It turns out that snakes don’t carry coronaviruses and that bats aren’t sold at a seafood market. Neither are pangolins, for that matter, an endangered species valued for their scales as much as for their meat.The evidence points to SARS-CoV-2 research being carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virus may have been carried out of the lab by an infected worker or crossed over into humans when they unknowingly dined on a lab animal. Whatever the vector, Beijing authorities are now clearly scrambling to correct the serious problems with the way their labs handle deadly pathogens.China has unleashed a plague on its own people. It’s too early to say how many in China and other countries will ultimately die for the failures of their country’s state-run microbiology labs, but the human cost will be high.But not to worry. Xi has assured us that he is controlling biosecurity risks “to protect the people’s health.” PLA bioweapons experts are in charge.I doubt the Chinese people will find that very reassuring. Neither should we.",0

Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem.",1
People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19. Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.,1
"Are people with high blood pressure (hypertension) at higher risk from COVID-19?At this time, we do not think that people with high blood pressure and no other underlying health conditions are more likely than others to get severely ill from COVID-19. Although many people who have gotten severely ill from COVID-19 have high blood pressure, they are often older or have other medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, and serious heart conditions that place them at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.If you have high blood pressure, it’s critically important that you keep your blood pressure under control to lower your risk for heart disease and strokes. Take your blood pressure medications as directed, keep a log of your blood pressure every day if you are able to take your blood pressure at home, and work with your healthcare team to make sure your blood pressure is well controlled. Any changes to your medications should be made in consultation with your healthcare team.
Should I continue to take my blood pressure medication?Yes. Continue to take your blood pressure medications exactly as prescribed and make lifestyle modifications agreed upon in your treatment plan. Continue all your regular medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), as prescribed by your healthcare team. This is recommended by current clinical guidelines from the American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America, and the American College of Cardiology",1
"COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.  Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir. However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.",1

The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. Most international destinations now have ongoing community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19, as does the United States. Community spread means some people have been infected and it is not known how or where they became exposed. Learn more about the spread of this coronavirus that is causing COVID-19.",1
"The complete clinical picture of COVID-19 is not fully known. Reported illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some people with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that the majority of COVID-19 illnesses are mild, an early reportexternal icon out of China found serious illness in 16% of people who were infected.  A CDC Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report that looked at severity of disease among COVID-19 patients in the United States by age group found that 80% of deaths were among adults 65 years and older, with the highest percentage of severe outcomes occurring in people 85 years and older. People with serious underlying medical conditions — like serious heart conditions, chronic lung disease, and diabetes, for example — also seem to be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness.",1
"A pandemic is a global outbreak of disease. Pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread between people sustainably. Because there is little to no pre-existing immunity against the new virus, it spreads worldwide.The virus that causes COVID-19 is infecting people and spreading easily from person-to-person. On March 11, the COVID-19 outbreak was characterized as a pandemic by the WHOexternal icon.This is the first pandemic known to be caused by a new coronavirus. In the past century, there have been four pandemics caused by the emergence of new influenza viruses. As a result, most research and guidance around pandemics is specific to influenza, but the same premises can be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemics of respiratory disease follow a certain progression outlined in a “Pandemic Intervals Framework.” Pandemics begin with an investigation phase, followed by recognition, initiation, and acceleration phases. The peak of illnesses occurs at the end of the acceleration phase, which is followed by a deceleration phase, during which there is a decrease in illnesses. Different countries can be in different phases of the pandemic at any point in time and different parts of the same country can also be in different phases of a pandemic.",1
"Based on what we know now, persons at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:People 65 years and older.People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility. People of all ages with serious underlying medical conditions",1
"The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.",1
"The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e. time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials. The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.Learn more about CDC’s guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.",1
"Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.",1
"Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.",1
"Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.",1
"It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.",1
"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.",1
"Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we don’t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc. Regardless of temperature please follow CDC’s guidance for cleaning and disinfection.",1

"Technocrat scientists around the world are using CRISPR technology in top-secret labs to develop doomsday-type biological warfare weapons. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is such a center, and the most likely source of the coronavirus outbreak.TN does not endorse either GreatGameIndia or Dr. Francis Boyle, but the globalist censorship is notable and significant. For instance, the globalist publication, Foreign Policy, strongly refuted the “conspiracy theory” on January 29 with the headline, The Wuhan Virus Is Not a Lab-Made Bioweapon, and attacked GreatGameIndia and ZeroHedge in particular. ZeroHedge has been permanently banned from Twitter. In an explosive interview Dr. Francis Boyle, who drafted the Biological Weapons Act has given a detailed statement admitting that the 2019 Wuhan Coronavirus is an offensive Biological Warfare Weapon and that the World Health Organization (WHO) already knows about it.Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, that was approved unanimously by both Houses of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush.In an exclusive interview given to Geopolitics and Empire, Dr. Boyle discusses the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China and the Biosafety Level 4 laboratory (BSL-4) from which he believes the infectious disease escaped. He believes the virus is potentially lethal and an offensive biological warfare weapon or dual-use biowarfare weapons agent genetically modified with gain of function properties, which is why the Chinese government originally tried to cover it up and is now taking drastic measures to contain it. The Wuhan BSL-4 lab is also a specially designated World Health Organization (WHO) research lab and Dr. Boyle contends that the WHO knows full well what is occurring.Dr. Boyle also touches upon GreatGameIndia‘s exclusive report Coronavirus Bioweapon – where we reported in detail how Chinese Biowarfare agents working at the Canadian lab in Winnipeg were involved in the smuggling of Coronavirus to Wuhan’s lab from where it is believed to have been leaked.Dr. Boyle’s position is in stark contrast to the mainstream media’s narrative of the virus being originated from the seafood market, which is increasingly being questioned by many experts.
Recently, American Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas also dismantled the mainstream media’s claim on Thursday that pinned the coronavirus outbreak on a market selling dead and live animals.In a video accompanying his post, Cotton explained that the Wuhan wet market (which Cotton incorrectly referred to as a seafood market) has been shown by experts to not be the source of the deadly contagion.Cotton referenced a Lancet study which showed that many of the first cases of the novel coronavirus, including patient zero, had no connection to the wet market — devastatingly undermining mainstream media’s claim.“As one epidemiologist said: ‘That virus went into the seafood market before it came out of the seafood market.’ We still don’t know where it originated,” Cotton said.“I would note that Wuhan also has China’s only bio-safety level four super laboratory that works with the world’s most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.”Such concerns have also been raised by J.R. Nyquist, the well known author of the books “Origins of the Fourth World War” and “The Fool and His Enemy,” as well as co-author of “The New Tactics of Global War”. In his insightful article he published secret speechs given to high-level Communist Party cadres by Chinese Defense Minister Gen. Chi Haotian explaining a long-range plan for ensuring a Chinese national renaissance – the catalyst for which would be China’s secret plan to weaponiz viruses.Nyquist gave three different data points for making his case in analyzing Coronavirus. He writes:The third data point worth considering: the journal GreatGameIndia has published a piece titled “Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It.”",0

"Not long before Chinese coronavirus started making global headlines, The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, held a high-level pandemic exercise called “Event 201” that seems to have been a predictive blueprint for what’s now transpiring with the coronavirus outbreak.On October 18, 2019, representatives from each of the aforementioned groups descended on New York City to discuss how they would respond to “a severe pandemic” much like the one we’re now being told is spreading across China and into the West.The exercise “illustrated areas where public / private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences,” an official announcement from Event 201 reads.“In recent years, the world has seen a growing number of epidemic events, amounting to approximately 200 events annually,” the announcement goes on to explain. “These events are increasing, and they are disruptive to health, economies, and society.”According to the event’s organizers, a pandemic like the one we could be seeing form right now before our very eyes requires “cooperation” among governments, industries, and “key international institutions” – the latter presumably referring to organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Is coronavirus yet another ploy to thin the “herd” and sell more vaccines?The timing of Event 201 is nothing short of suspicious in light of the fact that coronavirus is all the media is talking about right now. It’s even eclipsing President Trump’s impeachment proceedings in the Senate, with news about entire cities in China that are home to tens of millions of people being put under mandatory quarantine.We’re also seeing headlines about coronavirus popping up in major U.S. cities like Seattle, Houston and Chicago, which is starting to generate panic here in our own country about how far this thing will go before either fizzling out – a best-case scenario – or spreading like wildfire.As Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, is now warning, the rapid adaptation or mutation of coronavirus suggests that this might be another weaponized viral strain that was intentionally unleashed for eugenics purposes.Mainstream reporting is admitting that coronavirus is constantly changing like some kind of self-replicating bioweapon, which is all too convenient considering that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Pirbright Institute owns a patent on coronavirus for vaccine creation purposes.Was this whole outbreak engineered for the purpose of scaring the general public into accepting yet another government vaccine? Is it also about depopulating the planet as part of Bill Gates’ admitted efforts to use vaccination and “health care” as a means of reducing the world’s population by 10 to 15 percent?Time will tell what becomes of this latest public health scare, but one thing is for sure: Bill Gates and his eugenicist buddies are chomping at the bit to vaccinate the entire planet against coronavirus and any other disease they can conjure up as a deadly bioweapon.At the current time, the fatality rate associated with coronavirus infection is relatively low, around two percent. But that could very quickly change as the virus mutates and adapts to new environments, creating the horrific scenario predicted by Event 201.“Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global – a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences,” the Event 201 description ominously forebodes.“A severe pandemic, which becomes ‘Event 201,’ would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions.”To keep up with the latest news about coronavirus, be sure to check out Outbreak.news.You can also learn more about how many of these contagion scares are pre-planned, engineered 0 flag events at 0Flag.news.",0
"The ""novel Coronavirus"" outbreak affecting China and many other countries right now, has been determined to be a military BIO-WEAPON, which was being worked on at the Wuhan Virology Laboratory by China's People's Liberation Army, Nanjiang Command.  Somehow, it got out.  The world is now facing a massive wipe-out of humanity as a result.The proof that this virus is a genetically-modified Bat-SARS-Like Virus, manipulated by the Chinese Army, appears below.  The evidence is irrefutable.Two separate components of genetic sequencing from HIV-1,  the virus which causes AIDS, were added to Bat-SARS-Like coronavirus in the laboratory, thereby allowing it to infect human lungs via the ACES2 receptors in our lungs, and to disrupt the human body ability to fight it off, by reducing human leukocytes.BIO-WEAPON PROOF.. Make no mistake: this disease is, in fact, a MILITARY biological weapon.   The disease sequence from the original Bat coronavirus was uploaded to the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the US National Library of Medicine, in the year 2018 by China's Institute of Military Medicine, Nanjing Command.  The image below from the National Center for Biotechnology Information proves the upload. That Bat-SARS-Like coronavirus was issued Reference ID: AVP 70833.1 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the U.S. Library of Medicine.The present outbreak of ""novel Coronavirus"" was uploaded to that same National Center for Biotechnology Information in January of this year by the Shanghai Public Heath Clinical Center and was issued Reference ID: QHD3418.1.  Here is proof of THAT upload. Using the test facilities known as BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) from the U.S. National Library of Medicine researchers have determined that the ""virus envelope"" of those two separate diseases, are 100% identical!   Here is the BLAST Test result. a new study shows that elements of HIV have been found in the new ""novel coronavirus!""   From that study:We are currently witnessing a major epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV). The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.There is no way in nature that the Bat coronavirus could fortuitously acquire the HIV genetic sequences, without causing a mutation of the Virus Envelope.   The ONLY way the virus envelope could obtain the HIV genetics and still remain 100% identical to the 2018 sample, is if the HIV genes were added in a laboratory.So what the human race is now facing, is an accidentally-released military bio-weapon.  The original Bat-SARS-Like Coronavirus was identified by China's People's Liberation Army, through the Institute of Military Medicine, Nanjiang Command in the year 2018.  They uploaded the virus sequence and they were the sole entity in possession of the virus.Here we are, two years later, and the virus they had has been changed in a way that cannot occur in nature without mutating the virus envelope protein.This isn't rocket science; this is as plain as day.  China conducted genetic manipulation of their Bat-SARS-like virus and created a new virus capable of infecting humans.  That new virus was apparently accidentally-released and is the ""novel coronavirus"" the world is now battling.I am sorry to have to report, many of us are very likely to LOSE this battle.  Just like many are already losing their battle inside China and elsewhere.QUARANTINE. Within the first month of this outbreak in China, the government there effectively QUARANTINED more than fifty-six MILLION people (56,000,000) in nineteen (19) major cities, even though China reported publicly that only a few hundred were infected and only about 25 had died by that time.WHY?Why would China lockdown 19 cities and effectively Quarantine 56 Million people for such a trivial disease?   Because China KNEW it wasn't trivial.  China KNEW it was a military bio-weapon which had accidentally gotten out.  And China also KNEW how far this would spread and how fast.  China is guilty as sin.DISEASE FACTS:
Here are the now-established FACTS about this disease:This disease has an eighty-three percent (83%) infection rate.  That means if 100 people are EXPOSED to this virus, 83 WILL get sick from it.The Disease can spread by AIR.  It is HIGHLY, HIGHLY contagious.When a person breathes, virus comes out with those breaths.  Same thing when a person sneezes or coughs. Same when urinating or having a bowel movement.  ALL OF IT HAS VIRUS IN IT.The virus can live OUTSIDE a person, in the air or on a surface, for a minimum of five days, and a maximum of twenty eight days.So if an infected person goes into a store or supermarket, or public bathroom, or a school, office, warehouse . . . . or anywhere . . . . touches products on shelves and puts anything back, or sneezes or coughs, his virus gets on the products in that store or supermarket, bathroom, school, office, warehouse, etc., and can survive.YOU walk-in a couple minutes, hours or even DAYS later, and pick up the same item, or even smell their stink in the bathroom - POW, you're infected.
WORSE: This virus can infect others through the eyes and ears. Let's say you're walking inside somewhere and an infected person was there minutes earlier and coughed or sneezed.   The cough or sneeze threw microscopic droplets into the air, which float for awhile.  A few minutes later, you walk through that air.  One or more of the microscopic droplets gets on your eye.  You don't even KNOW it because the things are so small. You blink.  We all blink.Your eye lid pushes the virus off the surface of your eye, down into the bottom eye area, and the virus washes down into your tear duct.  POW- you're infected.It cannot be overstated that this virus is the worst public disease crisis the world has faced in over 100 years.  Not since the Spanish Flu of 1918 has the world faced such death and this is already heading toward being far WORSE than the Spanish Flu.The Spanish Flu spread worldwide during 1918-1919.  In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States.When a disease outbreak occurs, one of the measurements that scientists use to see how badly the disease will spread is known as R0.The 1918-1919 pandemic-causing Spanish flu is estimated to have had an R0 ranging from 1.4 – 2.8, with a mean of 2.  This means that for every person infected, that person could be expected to infect another 1.4 to 2.8 additional people.I regret to report that the R0 of this Bio-Weapon is already showing itself to be R4.08   . . .  FAAAAAAR Worse than the 1918 Spanish Flu.Here's where things get very bad, very fast.According to Satistia, the number of all hospital beds in the U.S. 1975-2017, is decreasing. In 1975, there were about 1.5 million hospital beds in the U.S., but until 2017 the number dropped to just about 931 thousand. Aug 9, 2019.According to TrendingEconomics, Hospital beds (per 1,000 people) in United States was reported at 2.9 in 2013, according to the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources. Hospital beds include inpatient beds available in public, private, general, and specialized hospitals and rehabilitation centers.Using the Infection Rate of 83% listed above, out of 1,000 people exposed to this Bio-Weapon, 830 will become infected.There are 2.9 Hospital beds per thousand US citizens.  So when 830 people get infected, how many can those 2.9 hospital beds hold???????   Yea. What happens to the rest?   They cannot get hospital care.Right now, when a person cannot get hospital care for this disease, the death rate for such people is 65-70%.That means me and you.  Dead.IT CAN (AND PROBABLY WILL) HAPPEN HERE. Many of the 56 Million people in 19 Quarantined cities have not eaten in days because there is no food remaining in the cities.  This is causing rioting.Delivery trucks are prohibited from entering these contaminated cities, for fear of spreading the Coronavirus to outlying areas.  People are literally FIGHTING each other to get food:People are trying virtually anything they can to ESCAPE the quarantine, to get food:Roadblocks erected by bulldozers, bucket loaders and backhoes, consisting of large piles of dirt, rocks, and other obstructions, now appear on most roads into and out of Quarantined cities.Some of these barriers were erected by government while others were erected by people in small towns and villages to keep the infected OUT.In the meantime, people throughout China are still simply DROPPING DEAD in their tracks:People in some areas are attacking others for merely COMING IN to their neighborhood; WARNING: People hit in head with PIPES:OUTSIDE CHINA, people are also dropping dead from this virus.In Mexico, this poor man waited far too long, until the disease became Hemorrhagic;  THIS is how this disease ends. Things inside China are getting so bad, Police are now BOARDING-UP People inside their apartments to KEEP THEM IN!And MORE people Nailed-in to their own homes:And once the police leave, other people are coming and SETTING THE HOMES ON FIRE to burn the infected people to death!CHINA ORDERS ALL PETS KILLED.Residential committees, village officials and companies from various provinces and municipalities issued a strict order to locals after receiving instructions from their superiors to tackle the epidemic, it has emerged.  They have ordered citizens to ""get rid of"" their pets or face having them culled.One village in Hebei urged all households to 'deal with' their pets within five days, otherwise officials would 'handle' them altogether; while another residential committee in Shaanxi instructed people to 'consider the overall situation' and dispose of their cats and dogs immediately.China says pets can carry the bio-weapon virus and spread it to others.China is only about 30 Days into this outbreak, and their entire country and society are already collapsing.   What you see above OVER THERE, is just 30 days away from happening OVER HERE.Are you preparing?Bear in mind that all this is just ONE MONTH into the outbreak.  ONE MONTH!What we see happening in China, can -- and very likely WILL -- happen here, in America.Today (Saturday February 1) A California man has tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the seventh confirmed case in the United States.The unidentified man is a resident of Santa Clara County, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Friday afternoon, according to local news reports.HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF.The Medical Infrastructure of the United States (and pretty much every other country) simply CANNOT HANDLE THIS from the perspective of how many get infected and how fast that happens.  There simply are not enough hospital beds, respirators, negative-pressure infectious disease isolation rooms.   Once the virus gets here in earnest (it probably already is but we won't know for ten days) the medical system will be quickly overwhelmed. We could see Medical Infrastructure COLLAPSE here in the USA the same as it is happening in China.When things go wild weasel here in America, there will be all sorts of unanticipated service disruptions. The general public remains blissfully unaware of the utter disaster coming at us, because the mass-media is keeping rather quiet about the situation.  But when they can't keep quiet any longer, there will be PANIC.You should PREPARE NOW because once the SHTF, it will be too late.Here are suggested ""Preps"" to try to get yourself and your family through what's coming.  There is precious little time left.The best strategy for this is NOT to be exposed.   Fat chance of that; we ALL go out: Work, school, shopping, recreation, and so forth.So how might we protect ourselves while we're out?Well, the fact this virus can be spread by air, in addition to staying alive on surfaces like counter tops, desks, water fountains, door handles, inside cars and buses, product packages on store shelves that someone else handled, or sneezed-on or coughed-on,  - including ones that get delivered by mail, FedEx, UPS, etc. --  complicates things greatly.Step One: Stay home.   Do not go out unless you absolutely MUST.Step Two: Presuming you have to go out (we ALL do) wear a filter mask  eye and hand protective gear (below).The N-95 filter masks are almost completely sold out already, nationwide.  So you can get a better mask rated as N-100 or P-100 for the time being until THEY sell out.  Links to various suppliers are HERE-N-95 and HERE N-100. You can also get the VASTLY AVAILABLE   3M 7500 (HERE)  which uses 3M 2091 filters  (HERE)   This mask system is more expensive, but it works and is widely still available. Get Eye Protection, either cheap swimmer goggles (HERE) or better safety goggles.Get a box of rubber/nitrile Gloves. Wear this gear when you go out.Yes, you'll look and feel ridiculous.   But you are much more likely to have the last laugh because YOU are protecting yourself.THIS IS URGENTLY IMPORTANT: The absolute moment you get home, take off your shoes and leave them in the foyer.  DO NOT WALK AROUND YOUR HOUSE IN SHOES YOU WORE OUTSIDE. 
You may have walked on a large amount of infected material as you were out and if you wear those shoes in the house, the virus will spread in the house.
Next: Go into the bathroom, take off your clothing, put it in a hamper or plastic bag, and take a shower.  You HAVE TO WASH OFF any virus that may have landed on your body or hair, while you were out.Put on clean garments.  You cannot go sit in your chair or lay on your couch or bed in clothing you wore outside.  The virus will come off the clothing, onto the furniture and pow, someone in the house catches it.Make every person in your household do this the absolute moment they come home.  This virus is HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS and it KILLS people.  We cannot skimp or get lazy protecting ourselves.Eat right, take vitamins (I use Centrum), and, I don't want to sound hokey, or like some Bible thumper,  pray to Almighty God that you be protected by Him during this crisis.  I'm not kidding.  I mean it: PRAY.Even if you haven't prayed in decades, start now.  ""Hi God, it's me (so and so).  I know I haven't prayed to you in a long time, but I'm coming back to you now.  . . . .""And then talk honestly and earnestly to him, in a very quiet voice.Just remember, this is God, not a magician to be summoned to do tricks or render services at our beckon call.  He made us.  We are HIS to do with a HE sees fit.OTHER ""PREPS"" with Links. Have Emergency food (HERE, HERE, and HERE) in the house in case Quarantine gets implemented, so you and your family can eat for the 6 weeks or so such Quarantines are likely to last. Have Emergency Water (HERE) stored up in case the water supply gets contaminated.Here is a complete list of ""Preps"" that folks might consider for themselves.Please pass this article along to those you care about; No other source is providing this type of self-help advice and there isn't much time left before all hell breaks loose.",0

"Humanity is imprisoned by a killer pandemic. People are being arrested for surfing in the ocean and meditating in nature. Nations are collapsing. Hungry citizens are rioting for food. The media has generated so much confusion and fear that people are begging for salvation in a syringe. Billionaire patent owners are pushing for globally mandated vaccines. Anyone who refuses to be injected with experimental poisons will be prohibited from travel, education and work. No, this is not a synopsis for a new horror movie. This is our current reality.Let’s back up to address how we got here.In the early 1900s, America’s first Billionaire, John D. Rockefeller bought a German pharmaceutical company that would later assist Hitler to implement his eugenics-based vision by manufacturing chemicals and poisons for war. Rockefeller wanted to eliminate the competitors of Western medicine, so he submitted a report to Congress declaring that there were too many doctors and medical schools in America, and that all natural healing modalities were unscientific quackery. Rockefeller called for the standardization of medical education, whereby only his organization be allowed to grant medical school licenses in the US. And so began the practice of immune suppressive, synthetic and toxic drugs. Once people had become dependent on this new system and the addictive drugs it provided, the system switched to a paid program, creating lifelong customers for the Rockefellers. Currently, medical error is the third leading cause of death in the US. Rockefeller’s secret weapon to success was the strategy known as, “problem-reaction-solution.” Create a problem, escalate fear, then offer a pre-planned solution. Sound familiar?Flash forward to 2020. They named it COVID19. Our leaders of world health predicted millions would die. The National Guard was deployed. Makeshift hospitals were erected to care for a massive overflow of patients. Mass graves were dug. Terrifying news reports had people everywhere seeking shelter to avoid contact. The plan was unfolding with diabolical precision, but the masters of the Pandemic underestimated one thing... the people. Medical professionals and every-day citizens are sharing critical information online. The overlords of big tech have ordered all dissenting voices to be silenced and banned, but they are too late. The slumbering masses are awake and aware that something is not right. Quarantine has provided the missing element: time. Suddenly, our overworked citizenry has ample time to research and investigate for themselves. Once you see, you can’t unsee.The window of opportunity is open like never before. For the first time in human history, we have the world’s attention. Plandemic will expose the scientific and political elite who run the scam that is our global health system, while laying out a new plan; a plan that allows all of humanity to reconnect with healing forces of nature. 2020 is the code for perfect vision. It is also the year that will go down in history as the moment we finally opened our eyes.",0

"I work in the healthcare field. Here’s the problem, we are testing people for any strain of a Coronavirus. Not specifically for COVID-19. There are no reliable tests for a specific COVID-19 virus. There are no reliable agencies or media outlets for reporting numbers of actual COVID-19 virus cases. This needs to be addressed first and foremost. Every action and reaction to COVID-19 is based on totally flawed data and we simply can not make accurate assessments.This is why you’re hearing that most people with COVID-19 are showing nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. That’s because most Coronavirus strains are nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. The few actual novel Coronavirus cases do have some worse respiratory responses, but still have a very promising recovery rate, especially for those without prior issues.The ‘gold standard’ in testing for COVID-19 is laboratory isolated/purified coronavirus particles free from any contaminants and particles that look like viruses but are not, that have been proven to be the cause of the syndrome known as COVID-19 and obtained by using proper viral isolation methods and controls (not the PCR that is currently being used or Serology /antibody tests which do not detect virus as such). PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to look for ‘viral sequences’, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem to match parts of a known viral genome.The problem is the test is known not to work.It uses ‘amplification’ which means taking a very very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analyzed. Obviously any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified leading to potentially gross errors of discovery.Additionally, it’s only looking for partial viral sequences, not whole genomes, so identifying a single pathogen is next to impossible even if you ignore the other issues.The Mickey Mouse test kits being sent out to hospitals, at best, tell analysts you have some viral DNA in your cells. Which most of us do, most of the time. It may tell you the viral sequence is related to a specific type of virus – say the huge family of coronavirus. But that’s all. The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus like COVID-19 is nonsense.And that’s not even getting into the other issue – viral load.If you remember the PCR works by amplifying minute amounts of DNA. It therefore is useless at telling you how much virus you may have. And that’s the only question that really matters when it comes to diagnosing illness. Everyone will have a few virus kicking round in their system at any time, and most will not cause illness because their quantities are too small. For a virus to sicken you you need a lot of it, a massive amount of it. But PCR does not test viral load and therefore can’t determine if it is present in sufficient quantities to sicken you.If you feel sick and get a PCR test any random virus DNA might be identified even if they aren’t at all involved in your sickness which leads to 0 diagnosis.And coronavirus are incredibly common. A large percentage of the world human population will have covi DNA in them in small quantities even if they are perfectly well or sick with some other pathogen.Do you see where this is going yet? If you want to create a totally 0 panic about a totally 0 pandemic – pick a coronavirus.They are incredibly common and there’s tons of them. A very high percentage of people who have become sick by other means (flu, bacterial pneumonia, anything) will have a positive. PCR test for covi even if you’re doing them properly and ruling out contamination, simply because covis are so common.There are hundreds of thousands of flu and pneumonia victims in hospitals throughout the world at any one time.All you need to do is select the sickest of these in a single location – say Wuhan – administer PCR tests to them and claim anyone showing viral sequences similar to a coronavirus (which will inevitably be quite a few) is suffering from a ‘new’ disease.Since you already selected the sickest flu cases a fairly high proportion of your sample will go on to die.You can then say this ‘new’ virus has a CFR higher than the flu and use this to infuse more concern and do more tests which will of course produce more ‘cases’, which expands the testing, which produces yet more ‘cases’ and so on and so on.Before long you have your ‘pandemic’, and all you have done is use a simple test kit trick to convert the worst flu and pneumonia cases into something new that doesn’t actually exist.Now just run the same scam in other countries. Making sure to keep the fear message running high so that people will feel panicky and less able to think critically.Your only problem is going to be that – due to the fact there is no actual new deadly pathogen but just regular sick people, you are mislabeling your case numbers, and especially your deaths, are going to be way too low for a real new deadly virus pandemic.But you can stop people pointing this out in several ways.You can claim this is just the beginning and more deaths are imminent. Use this as an excuse to quarantine everyone and then claim the quarantine prevented the expected millions of dead.You can tell people that ‘minimizing’ the dangers is irresponsible and bully them into not talking about numbers.You can talk crap about made up numbers hoping to blind people with pseudoscience.You can start testing well people (who, of course, will also likely have shreds of coronavirus DNA in them) and thus inflate your ‘case figures’ with ‘asymptomatic carriers’ (you will of course have to spin that to sound deadly even though any virologist knows the more symptom-less cases you have the less deadly is your pathogen.Take these 4 simple steps and you can have your own entirely manufactured pandemic up and running in weeks.",0
"Over 86,500 people have reportedly died in the United States from the Coronavirus, and the fear generated by those deaths is driving the public policy debate. But that number is a dramatic overcount. Our metrics include deaths that have nothing to do with the virus. The problem is even worse as the Centers for Disease Control over counts even some of these cases and the government has created financial incentives for this misreporting. Relying on these flawed numbers is destroying businesses and jobs and costing lives.“The case definition is very simplistic,” Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of Illinois Department of Public Health, explains. “It means, at the time of death, it was a COVID positive diagnosis. That means, that if you were in hospice and had already been given a few weeks to live, and then you also were found to have COVID, that would be counted as a COVID death. It means, technically even if you died of clear alternative cause, but you had COVID at the same time, it’s still listed as a COVID death.”Medical examiners in Michigan use the same definition. In Macomb and Oakland Counties, where most of the deaths occurred, medical examiners classify any deaths as Coronavirus deaths when the postmortem test is positive. Even people who died in suicides and automobile accidents meet that definition.
Still, these broad definitions are not due to a few rogue public health officials. The rules direct them to do this. Unlike other countries,“if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death,” as Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, recently noted.Classifications go beyond even these broad categories. New York is classifying cases as Coronavirus deaths even when postmortem tests have been negative. Despite negative tests, classifications are based on symptoms, even though the symptoms are often very similar to those of the seasonal flu. The Centers for Disease Control guidance explicitly acknowledges the uncertainty that doctors can face. When Coronavirus cases are “suspected,” they advise doctors that “it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate.”That isn’t just a theoretical issue. On April 21st, when New York City’s death toll rose above 10,000, the New York Times reported that the city included “3,700 additional people who were presumed to have died of the coronavirus but had never tested positive” – a more than 50 percent increase in the number of cases.But the problem is worse than this broad definition implies. Birx and others believe that the CDC is over counting cases. The Washington Post reports they are concerned that the CDC’s “antiquated” accounting system is double counting cases and inflating mortality and case counts “by as much as 25 percent.”
There are additional reasons for concern. Some doctors feel pressure from hospitals to list deaths as due to the Coronavirus, even when they don’t believe that is the case, “to make it look a little bit worse than it is.” There are financial incentives that might make a difference for hospitals and doctors. The CARES Act adds a 20 percent premium for COVID-19 Medicare patients.Incentives matter. When the government increased the disability compensation for air traffic controllers, a lot more controllers suddenly started claiming to be disabled. When unemployment insurance payments increase, more people become unemployed and stay unemployed for longer periods. When the government offers flood insurance that charges everyone the same insurance premium regardless of the risk level in their area, more people build homes in frequently flooded areas.The Washington Post and others claim that we are undercounting the true number of deaths. They reach that conclusion by showing the total number of deaths from all causes is greater than we would normally expect from March through early May, and that this excess is actually due to deaths not being accurately labeled as due to the Coronavirus. But these are simply not normal times. Lots of people with heart and other problems aren’t going to the hospital for fear of the virus. Surgeries for many serious conditions are being put off. The stress of the situation is increasing suicides and other illnesses.Deaths that have absolutely nothing to do with the Coronavirus count as virus deaths. Add to that claims that the CDC is double counting some of these improperly identified cases and the perverse financial incentives created by the government, and you have a real mess when crucial decisions are being made based in large part on this data.Erroneous data unduly scare people about the risks of the disease. It keeps the country locked down longer than necessary, which destroys peoples’ lives and livelihoods in many other ways. Exaggerated fears of the virus endanger lives by keeping people from obtaining treatment for other medical problems.  It also makes it impossible to accurately compare policies across countries.It is hard to believe that we are basing such crucial decisions on such flawed data.",0
"In earlier articles I related the opinions of biochemists and bio-warfare specialists on the circumstances justifying suspicion of a virus being created in a lab and deliberately released in a foreign country as a means of either low- or high-intensity warfare, or as merely a means of destabilising a nation and perhaps severely damaging its economy, with the loss of life being an added plus. The US is the country that appears most devoted to biological warfare, though a number of other nations are eager participants, including the UK and Israel.I would remind readers here of the statement from PNAC, in a report titled, “Rebuilding America’s Defenses”, that “Advanced forms of biological warfare that can ‘target’ specific genotypes may transform biological warfare … to a politically useful tool.”
This subject is difficult to discuss openly in a nation of people, or even within international bodies like the UN. The infliction of such a pathogen onto a nation is clearly an act of war. However, if the leaders have not irrefutable proof of a bio-weapon and its source, and are not prepared for a military response, the only solution is to remain silent and emphasise research on defensive measures in the event of a recurrence. Even with overwhelming circumstantial evidence, a public statement or an accusation would likely be derided as yet another unfounded conspiracy theory. This is essentially the same with disclosure to the UN General Assembly or other such body; an accusation lacking conclusive proof would merely be derided and embarrassing.This is similarly true with destabilization and violence, as China has very recently experienced in Hong Kong (and which has not yet stabilized), and the violence in Tibet and Xinjiang. The American ‘black  hand’ (from the American consulate) was caught red-handed in Hong Kong and sources of funding the HK terrorists are now being identified. There is no dispute anywhere that the violence and terrorism in both Tibet and Xinjiang were American-inspired and funded, but absolute irrefutable proof is lacking. All of these are clearly acts of war but, lacking final proof, responses are limited to defensive measures.In a previous article on China’s new coronavirus, I referred to a thesis on Biological Weapons by Leonard Horowitz and Zygmunt Dembek who stated that clear signs of a genetically-engineered bio-warfare agent were (a) a disease caused by an uncommon (unusual, rare, or unique) agent, with (b) lack of an epidemiological explanation, i.e. no clear idea of source; (c) An “unusual manifestation and/or geographic distribution”, such as race-specificity; and (d) multiple sources of infection.China’s coronavirus appears to satisfy all four criteria. This is especially true since it appears that only one Caucasian (and some Japanese) has been infected to date, with the virus so far appearing to be tightly focused to Chinese.Also the statement by Dr. Leonard Horowitz who quoted one military expert as saying “Even if you suspect biological terrorism, it’s hard to prove. It’s equally hard to disprove . . . You can trace an arms shipment, but it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of a virus that comes from a bug.” Another expert stated  that a properly-done release of an infectious agent cannot be traced to its source and might be considered an “act of God”.In 2003, many Russian medical experts voiced the opinion that the SARS virus was most likely man-made and deliberately released as a weapon. Sergei Kolesnikov, a member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, said the propagation of the SARS virus might well have been caused by leaking a combat virus grown in bacteriological weapons labs because the natural compound [of contained virus genome sections] was impossible, that the mix could never appear in nature, but could be done only in a laboratory.At the same time, Nikolai Filatov, the head of Moscow’s epidemiological services, stated he believed SARS was man-made because “there is no vaccine for this virus, its make-up is unclear, it has not been very widespread and the population is not immune to it.""
It appears the Russians may be arriving at the same conclusion for China’s new virus in 2020. The text below consists of a condensed version of an interview conducted by the Russian news portal mk.ru, on January 27, 2020, with Igor Nikulin, a former member of the UN Commission on Biological and Chemical Weapons (1998-2003).The article begins by noting that the prevalence of the coronavirus in China is increasing, while Beijing takes extraordinary measures to reduce the impact of this disaster. It further states that a number of experts “note strange coincidences in the circumstances” of the emergence of this new infection and are reluctant to exclude an “artificial origin”. Mr. Nikulin was asked to comment on the situation.Russian Expert: “We Cannot Rule Out Man Made Origin of these Infections”
Interviewer: in recent years dangerous for humans coronaviruses appear more and more often. What does this have to do with anything?Nikulin: With these coronaviruses, the situation is really very strange. Until 2000, none of them “jumped on a person.” They have been living next to humans for millions of years, but always only on some animals parasitized. For example, on camels, as in the case of [MERS]. Or on bats, birds, anyone, but this infection did not pass on to a person. And there are already 8 deadly viruses in 20 years. It’s obviously too much.Interviewer: So we can’t rule out the man-made origin of these infections?Nikulin: If it was the first outbreak, you’d think it was a natural mutation. But it is hardly natural, because every few years such incidents are repeated. It’s atypical pneumonia, it’s avian flu, it’s swine flu, it’s something else.Interviewer: Some experts note that the time of the outbreak in China seems to be chosen specifically to cause maximum harm. Just on the eve of the New Year on the Eastern calendar, when in China mass internal migration for the holidays, as well as events with the participation of a large number of people. And the place seemed to be specially selected. Historically and geographically, all roads in China lead to Wuhan. It is the largest transport hub, the largest international airport. Through it [planes] fly to the States, Australia, Japan, the Middle East, Paris, London, Moscow. Besides these coincidences, what can prove the artificial origin of the virus?”Nikulin: Just deciphering the genome. Its results may show if it is a virus of natural origin, or laboratory, when some recombinant “piece” is inserted into the gene . . . there are modern computer programs that allow you to read all this, decipher and compare with the samples available in databases.
Interviewer: Is it possible that the new coronavirus only affects people of Chinese nationality? So it’s set on certain features of the human gene?
Nikulin: If it turns out that this is indeed the case, then such a natural mutation cannot be accurate. It’s mathematical proof that it’s an artificially created virus.
Interviewer: In which labs can it appear?Nikulin: I can only assume. But look: China, like Russia, is surrounded by American research biolaboratories. They are in different countries along the perimeter of China’s borders – in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Taiwan, Philippines, South Korea, Japan. They were in Indonesia, but they closed them. And wherever there are these American biolaboratories, or near them, there are outbreaks of new diseases, often unknown. Threats to the local population are simply ignored by Americans. The main thing is that it was away from the territory of the United States.Interviewer: How many foreign biolaboratories do the U.S. have?Nikulin: It’s 400.Interviewer: They are overseen by the Pentagon?Nikulin: Of course. It’s all funded from the Pentagon budget. Therefore, it is not necessary to say that peaceful humanitarian research is being carried out there. Do you think the Pentagon’s money is being spent on peaceful research? No one is allowed in. These are military labs. When more than a hundred people died in Georgia near such a laboratory within one month, do you think someone was allowed to go there? No one was allowed into the American laboratory at all.
Those countries that consider themselves victims of bioterrorism should investigate all these cases and bring them up for international discussion. For example, to the UN Security Council. To raise the issue of the activities of American biolaboratories outside the United States. We have to do something. Because a lot of people are already suffering from it. And in general, it is necessary to strengthen the biosecurity of the country.",0

If that COVID-19 patient goes on a ventilator you get $39,000, three times as much.

"On rounds in a 20-bed intensive care unit one recent day, physician Joshua Denson assessed two patients with seizures, many with respiratory failure and others whose kidneys were on a dangerous downhill slide. Days earlier, his rounds had been interrupted as his team tried, and failed, to resuscitate a young woman whose heart had stopped. All shared one thing, says Denson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the Tulane University School of Medicine. “They are all COVID positive.”As the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 surges past 2.2 million globally and deaths surpass 150,000, clinicians and pathologists are struggling to understand the damage wrought by the coronavirus as it tears through the body. They are realizing that although the lungs are ground zero, its reach can extend to many organs including the heart and blood vessels, kidneys, gut, and brain.“The disease can attack almost anything in the body with devastating consequences,” says cardiologist Harlan Krumholz of Yale University and Yale-New Haven Hospital, who is leading multiple efforts to gather clinical data on COVID-19. “Its ferocity is breathtaking and humbling.”Understanding the rampage could help the doctors on the front lines treat the fraction of infected people who become desperately and sometimes mysteriously ill. Does a dangerous, newly observed tendency to blood clotting transform some mild cases into life-threatening emergencies? Is an overzealous immune response behind the worst cases, suggesting treatment with immune-suppressing drugs could help? What explains the startlingly low blood oxygen that some physicians are reporting in patients who nonetheless are not gasping for breath? “Taking a systems approach may be beneficial as we start thinking about therapies,” says Nilam Mangalmurti, a pulmonary intensivist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. What follows is a snapshot of the fast-evolving understanding of how the virus attacks cells around the body, especially in the roughly 5% of patients who become critically ill. Despite the more than 1000 papers now spilling into journals and onto preprint servers every week, a clear picture is elusive, as the virus acts like no pathogen humanity has ever seen. Without larger, prospective controlled studies that are only now being launched, scientists must pull information from small studies and case reports, often published at warp speed and not yet peer reviewed. “We need to keep a very open mind as this phenomenon goes forward,” says Nancy Reau, a liver transplant physician who has been treating COVID-19 patients at Rush University Medical Center. “We are still learning.”The infection begins.When an infected person expels virus-laden droplets and someone else inhales them, the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, enters the nose and throat. It finds a welcome home in the lining of the nose, according to a preprint from scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and elsewhere. They found that cells there are rich in a cell-surface receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Throughout the body, the presence of ACE2, which normally helps regulate blood pressure, marks tissues vulnerable to infection, because the virus requires that receptor to enter a cell. Once inside, the virus hijacks the cell’s machinery, making myriad copies of itself and invading new cells.As the virus multiplies, an infected person may shed copious amounts of it, especially during the first week or so. Symptoms may be absent at this point. Or the virus’ new victim may develop a fever, dry cough, sore throat, loss of smell and taste, or head and body aches.If the immune system doesn’t beat back SARS-CoV-2 during this initial phase, the virus then marches down the windpipe to attack the lungs, where it can turn deadly. The thinner, distant branches of the lung’s respiratory tree end in tiny air sacs called alveoli, each lined by a single layer of cells that are also rich in ACE2 receptors.Normally, oxygen crosses the alveoli into the capillaries, tiny blood vessels that lie beside the air sacs; the oxygen is then carried to the rest of the body. But as the immune system wars with the invader, the battle itself disrupts this healthy oxygen transfer. Front-line white blood cells release inflammatory molecules called chemokines, which in turn summon more immune cells that target and kill virus-infected cells, leaving a stew of fluid and dead cells—pus—behind. This is the underlying pathology of pneumonia, with its corresponding symptoms: coughing; fever; and rapid, shallow respiration (see graphic). Some COVID-19 patients recover, sometimes with no more support than oxygen breathed in through nasal prongs.But others deteriorate, often quite suddenly, developing a condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oxygen levels in their blood plummet and they struggle ever harder to breathe. On x-rays and computed tomography scans, their lungs are riddled with white opacities where black space—air—should be. Commonly, these patients end up on ventilators. Many die. Autopsies show their alveoli became stuffed with fluid, white blood cells, mucus, and the detritus of destroyed lung cells.An invader’s impact. In serious cases, SARS-CoV-2 lands in the lungs and can do deep damage there. But the virus, or the body’s response to it, can injure many other organs. Scientists are just beginning to probe the scope and nature of that harm. Click on organ name for more.Some clinicians suspect the driving force in many gravely ill patients’ downhill trajectories is a disastrous overreaction of the immune system known as a “cytokine storm,” which other viral infections are known to trigger. Cytokines are chemical signaling molecules that guide a healthy immune response; but in a cytokine storm, levels of certain cytokines soar far beyond what’s needed, and immune cells start to attack healthy tissues. Blood vessels leak, blood pressure drops, clots form, and catastrophic organ failure can ensue.Some studies have shown elevated levels of these inflammation-inducing cytokines in the blood of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. “The real morbidity and mortality of this disease is probably driven by this out of proportion inflammatory response to the virus,” says Jamie Garfield, a pulmonologist who cares for COVID-19 patients at Temple University Hospital.But others aren’t convinced. “There seems to have been a quick move to associate COVID-19 with these hyperinflammatory states. I haven’t really seen convincing data that that is the case,” says Joseph Levitt, a pulmonary critical care physician at the Stanford University School of Medicine.He’s also worried that efforts to dampen a cytokine response could backfire. Several drugs targeting specific cytokines are in clinical trials in COVID-19 patients. But Levitt fears those drugs may suppress the immune response that the body needs to fight off the virus. “There’s a real risk that we allow more viral replication,” Levitt says.Meanwhile, other scientists are zeroing in on an entirely different organ system that they say is driving some patients’ rapid deterioration: the heart and blood vessels.Striking the heart.In Brescia, Italy, a 53-year-old woman walked into the emergency room of her local hospital with all the classic symptoms of a heart attack, including telltale signs in her electrocardiogram and high levels of a blood marker suggesting damaged cardiac muscles. Further tests showed cardiac swelling and scarring, and a left ventricle—normally the powerhouse chamber of the heart—so weak that it could only pump one-third its normal amount of blood. But when doctors injected dye in the coronary arteries, looking for the blockage that signifies a heart attack, they found none. Another test revealed why: The woman had COVID-19.How the virus attacks the heart and blood vessels is a mystery, but dozens of preprints and papers attest that such damage is common. A 25 March paper in JAMA Cardiology documented heart damage in nearly 20% of patients out of 416 hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. In another Wuhan study, 44% of 36 patients admitted to the ICU had arrhythmias.The disruption seems to extend to the blood itself. Among 184 COVID-19 patients in a Dutch ICU, 38% had blood that clotted abnormally, and almost one-third already had clots, according to a 10 April paper in Thrombosis Research. Blood clots can break apart and land in the lungs, blocking vital arteries—a condition known as pulmonary embolism, which has reportedly killed COVID-19 patients. Clots from arteries can also lodge in the brain, causing stroke. Many patients have “dramatically” high levels of D-dimer, a byproduct of blood clots, says Behnood Bikdeli, a cardiovascular medicine fellow at Columbia University Medical Center.
“The more we look, the more likely it becomes that blood clots are a major player in the disease severity and mortality from COVID-19,” Bikdeli says.Infection may also lead to blood vessel constriction. Reports are emerging of ischemia in the fingers and toes—a reduction in blood flow that can lead to swollen, painful digits and tissue death.The more we look, the more likely it becomes that blood clots are a major player in the disease severity and mortality from COVID-19. In the lungs, blood vessel constriction might help explain anecdotal reports of a perplexing phenomenon seen in pneumonia caused by COVID-19: Some patients have extremely low blood-oxygen levels and yet are not gasping for breath. It’s possible that at some stages of disease, the virus alters the delicate balance of hormones that help regulate blood pressure and constricts blood vessels going to the lungs. So oxygen uptake is impeded by constricted blood vessels, rather than by clogged alveoli. “One theory is that the virus affects the vascular biology and that’s why we see these really low oxygen levels,” Levitt says.If COVID-19 targets blood vessels, that could also help explain why patients with pre-existing damage to those vessels, for example from diabetes and high blood pressure, face higher risk of serious disease. Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data on hospitalized patients in 14 U.S. states found that about one-third had chronic lung disease—but nearly as many had diabetes, and fully half had pre-existing high blood pressure.Mangalmurti says she has been “shocked by the fact that we don’t have a huge number of asthmatics” or patients with other respiratory diseases in HUP’s ICU. “It’s very striking to us that risk factors seem to be vascular: diabetes, obesity, age, hypertension.”Scientists are struggling to understand exactly what causes the cardiovascular damage. The virus may directly attack the lining of the heart and blood vessels, which, like the nose and alveoli, are rich in ACE2 receptors. Or perhaps lack of oxygen, due to the chaos in the lungs, damages blood vessels. Or a cytokine storm could ravage the heart as it does other organs.“We’re still at the beginning,” Krumholz says. “We really don’t understand who is vulnerable, why some people are affected so severely, why it comes on so rapidly … and why it is so hard [for some] to recover.”Multiple battlefields.The worldwide fears of ventilator shortages for failing lungs have received plenty of attention. Not so a scramble for another type of equipment: dialysis machines. “If these folks are not dying of lung failure, they’re dying of renal failure,” says neurologist Jennifer Frontera of New York University’s Langone Medical Center, which has treated thousands of COVID-19 patients. Her hospital is developing a dialysis protocol with different machines to support additional patients. The need for dialysis may be because the kidneys, abundantly endowed with ACE2 receptors, present another viral target.According to one preprint, 27% of 85 hospitalized patients in Wuhan had kidney failure. Another reported that 59% of nearly 200 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China’s Hubei and Sichuan provinces had protein in their urine, and 44% had blood; both suggest kidney damage. Those with acute kidney injury (AKI), were more than five times as likely to die as COVID-19 patients without it, the same Chinese preprint reported.“The lung is the primary battle zone. But a fraction of the virus possibly attacks the kidney. And as on the real battlefield, if two places are being attacked at the same time, each place gets worse,” says Hongbo Jia, a neuroscientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’s Suzhou Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology and a co-author of that study.Viral particles were identified in electron micrographs of kidneys from autopsies in one study, suggesting a direct viral attack. But kidney injury may also be collateral damage. Ventilators boost the risk of kidney damage, as do antiviral compounds including remdesivir, which is being deployed experimentally in COVID-19 patients. Cytokine storms also can dramatically reduce blood flow to the kidney, causing often-fatal damage. And pre-existing diseases like diabetes can increase the chances of kidney injury. “There is a whole bucket of people who already have some chronic kidney disease who are at higher risk for acute kidney injury,” says Suzanne Watnick, chief medical officer at Northwest Kidney Centers.Buffeting the brain.Another striking set of symptoms in COVID-19 patients centers on the brain and central nervous system. Frontera says neurologists are needed to assess 5% to 10% of coronavirus patients at her hospital. But she says that “is probably a gross underestimate” of the number whose brains are struggling, especially because many are sedated and on ventilators.Frontera has seen patients with the brain inflammation encephalitis, with seizures, and with a “sympathetic storm,” a hyperreaction of the sympathetic nervous system that causes seizurelike symptoms and is most common after a traumatic brain injury. Some people with COVID-19 briefly lose consciousness. Others have strokes. Many report losing their sense of smell. And Frontera and others wonder whether in some cases, infection depresses the brain stem reflex that senses oxygen starvation. This is another explanation for anecdotal observations that some patients aren’t gasping for air, despite dangerously low blood oxygen levels.
ACE2 receptors are present in the neural cortex and brain stem, says Robert Stevens, an intensive care physician at Johns Hopkins Medicine. But it’s not known under what circumstances the virus penetrates the brain and interacts with these receptors. That said, the coronavirus behind the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic—a close cousin of today’s culprit—could infiltrate neurons and sometimes caused encephalitis. On 3 April, a case study in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, from a team in Japan, reported traces of new coronavirus in the cerebrospinal fluid of a COVID-19 patient who developed meningitis and encephalitis, suggesting it, too, can penetrate the central nervous system.But other factors could be damaging the brain. For example, a cytokine storm could cause brain swelling, and the blood’s exaggerated tendency to clot could trigger strokes. The challenge now is to shift from conjecture to confidence, at a time when staff are focused on saving lives, and even neurologic assessments like inducing the gag reflex or transporting patients for brain scans risk spreading the virus.Last month, Sherry Chou, a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, began to organize a worldwide consortium that now includes 50 centers to draw neurological data from care patients already receive. The early goals are simple: Identify the prevalence of neurologic complications in hospitalized patients and document how they fare. Longer term, Chou and her colleagues hope to gather scans, lab tests, and other data to better understand the virus’ impact on the nervous system, including the brain.Chou speculates about a possible invasion route: through the nose, then upward and through the olfactory bulb—explaining reports of a loss of smell—which connects to the brain. “It’s a nice sounding theory,” she says. “We really have to go and prove that.”Most neurological symptoms “are reported from colleague to colleague by word of mouth,” Chou adds. “I don’t think anybody, and certainly not me, can say we’re experts.”Reaching the gut. In early March, a 71-year-old Michigan woman returned from a Nile River cruise with bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Initially doctors suspected she had a common stomach bug, such as Salmonella. But after she developed a cough, doctors took a nasal swab and found her positive for the novel coronavirus. A stool sample positive for viral RNA, as well as signs of colon injury seen in an endoscopy, pointed to a gastrointestinal (GI) infection with the coronavirus, according to a paper posted online in The American Journal of Gastroenterology. Her case adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting the new coronavirus, like its cousin SARS, can infect the lining of the lower digestive tract, where the crucial ACE2 receptors are abundant. Viral RNA has been found in as many as 53% of sampled patients’ stool samples. And in a paper in press at Gastroenterology, a Chinese team reported finding the virus’ protein shell in gastric, duodenal, and rectal cells in biopsies from a COVID-19 patient. “I think it probably does replicate in the gastrointestinal tract,” says Mary Estes, a virologist at Baylor College of Medicine.Recent reports suggest up to half of patients, averaging about 20% across studies, experience diarrhea, says Brennan Spiegel of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, co–editor-in-chief of AJG. GI symptoms aren’t on CDC’s list of COVID-19 symptoms, which could cause some COVID-19 cases to go undetected, Spiegel and others say. “If you mainly have fever and diarrhea, you won’t be tested for COVID,” says Douglas Corley of Kaiser Permanente, Northern California, co-editor of Gastroenterology.The presence of virus in the GI tract raises the unsettling possibility that it could be passed on through feces. But it’s not yet clear whether stool contains intact, infectious virus, or only RNA and proteins. To date, “We have no evidence” that fecal transmission is important, says coronavirus expert Stanley Perlman of the University of Iowa. CDC says that based on experiences with SARS and with the virus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, another dangerous cousin of the new coronavirus, the risk from fecal transmission is probably low.The intestines are not the end of the disease’s march through the body. For example, up to one-third of hospitalized patients develop conjunctivitis—pink, watery eyes—although it’s not clear that the virus directly invades the eye. Other reports suggest liver damage: More than half of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in two Chinese centers had elevated levels of enzymes indicating injury to the liver or bile ducts. But several experts told Science that direct viral invasion isn’t likely the culprit. They say other events in a failing body, like drugs or an immune system in overdrive, are more likely driving the liver damage.This map of the devastation that COVID-19 can inflict on the body is still just a sketch. It will take years of painstaking research to sharpen the picture of its reach, and the cascade of cardiovascular and immune effects it might set in motion. As science races ahead, from probing tissues under microscopes to testing drugs on patients, the hope is for treatments more wily than the virus that has stopped the world in its tracks.",1
"How will you know if you have the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease? Doctors have described some of the most common symptoms, including some rare ones, such as a loss of smell, that could signal you should get tested.According to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch, the virus could ultimately infect between 40% and 70% of the population worldwide in the coming year.Many of those cases would be mild, and some people might show no symptoms at all. But the prospect of being infected with a new virus can be frightening. As of April 27, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed nine coronavirus symptoms that tend to appear about 2 to 14 days after exposure, including: fever; cough; shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; chills; repeated shaking with chills; muscle pain; headache; sore throat; and new loss of taste or smell. The following symptoms, the CDC says, are emergency warning signs that you should seek immediate medical attention: trouble breathing; persistent pain or pressure in the chest; new confusion or inability to arouse; bluish lips or face; other severe symptoms that concern you.Doctors recently added ""loss of smell"" as a potential symptom that may show up alone without any other symptoms, Live Science reported. According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, as many as 98% of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized had a fever, between 76% and 82% had a dry cough, and 11% to 44% reported exhaustion and fatigue. The disease appears to become more severe with age, with the 30- to 79-year-old age range predominating the detected cases in Wuhan, where the outbreak began, according to a study in JAMA. Children seem to be at less risk of suffering noticeable symptoms of the disease. However, a recent study of 2,000 children confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 found that 6% developed severe or critical illness. The study is detailed in the March 16 issue of the journal Pediatrics.In more serious cases of COVID-19, patients experience pneumonia, which means their lungs begin to fill with pockets of pus or fluid. This leads to intense shortness of breath and painful coughing. Currently, testing for the virus that causes COVID-19 in the United States is limited to people with more severe symptoms, according to Paul Biddinger, the director of the emergency preparedness research, evaluation and practice program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who spoke in a university webcast March 2. This means that it isn't appropriate to be tested at the first sign of a fever or sniffle. Seeking medical care for mild illness can also potentially transmit that illness, or lead to catching new illnesses in the hospital or clinic, Biddinger added. Ultimately, the decisions about who should be tested are left to the discretion of state and local health departments, according to the CDC. ""Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested,"" the CDC says.
As of April 27, more than 5.4 million COVID-19 diagnostic tests have been run in the U.S., according to the COVID Tracking Project.If you become ill with these symptoms and think you've been exposed to the virus, the CDC recommends calling your doctor first rather than traveling to a clinic. Physicians work with state health departments and the CDC to determine who should be tested for the new virus. However, the CDC also recommends that people with COVID-19 or any respiratory illness monitor their symptoms carefully. Worsening shortness of breath is reason to seek medical care, particularly for older individuals or people with underlying health conditions. The CDC information page has more on what to do if you are sick. ",1
"If there was any doubt that the new coronavirus isn't just ""a bad flu,"" a new paper lays that myth to rest. The study authors found that in the U.S. there were 20 times more deaths per week from COVID-19 than from the flu in the deadliest week of an average influenza season.""Although officials may say that SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19] is 'just another flu,' this is not true,"" the authors, from Harvard Medical School and Emory University. Ever since the new coronavirus was discovered in early January, people have compared it with the flu, pointing out that influenza causes tens of thousands of deaths every year in the U.S. alone. Indeed, during the current flu season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were up to 62,000 flu deaths in the U.S. from October 2019 through April 2020.At a glance, this may appear similar to the toll of COVID-19, which as of early May, had caused about 65,000 U.S. deaths. (As of Thursday, May 13, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. was more than 82,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.)But this doesn't match what health care providers are seeing on the frontlines of the pandemic, particularly in hot zones (such as New York City), ""where ventilators have been in short supply and many hospitals have been stretched beyond their limits,"" the authors said.This comparison is flawed because the CDC estimates of flu deaths are just that — estimates rather than raw numbers. The CDC does not know the exact number of people who become sick with or die from the flu each year in the U.S. Rather, this number is estimated based on data collected on flu hospitalizations through surveillance in 13 states.On the other hand, reported COVID-19 deaths are actual counts of people who died from COVID-19, not estimates. In other words, comparing estimates of flu deaths with raw counts of COVID-19 deaths is like comparing ""apples to oranges,"" the authors said.So for the new study, the researchers looked at actual counts of flu deaths per week, and compared those with counts of COVID-19 deaths.Based on data from death certificates, during the deadliest week of flu season over the last several years, the counted number of U.S. deaths due to flu ranged from 351 during the 2015 to 2016 flu season to 1,626 during the 2017 to 2018 flu season, the authors said. The average number of flu deaths during the week of peak flu mortality in recent seasons (from 2013 to 2020) was 752 deaths.In contrast, for COVID-19, there were 15,455 deaths reported in the U.S. during the week ending April 21 (the highest weekly death toll during the pandemic so far)  the authors said .That means that the number of COVID-19 deaths for the week ending April 21 was about 10- to 40-fold higher than the number of influenza deaths for the most lethal week of the past seven flu seasons. That peak COVID-19 weekly death count is about 20 times higher than the average weekly peak flu death count, the authors said.The authors note that their analysis has some limitations, including that the number of COVID-19 deaths may be undercounted because of limitations with testing for SARS-CoV-2 and 0-negative test results. In addition, the authors point out that adult flu deaths are not required to be reported to public health authorities in the way that COVID-19 deaths are, potentially undercounting flu deaths as well. Still, ""our analysis suggests that comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 mortality and seasonal influenza mortality must be made using an apples-to-apples comparison, not an apples-to-oranges comparison,"" the authors concluded. ""Doing so better demonstrates the true threat to public health from COVID-19.""",1
"More data on mild and asymptomatic cases is desperately needed.As new reports of novel coronavirus cases surface along the U.S. West Coast, new research — and the existing disease surveillance network — may finally shed light on some of the most burning questions about the new virus, called SARS-CoV-2.Among the most pressing questions: How many cases are asymptomatic, versus mild, moderate or severe? And what is the real rate of fatalities compared with the total number of cases?Initial reports of the new coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China, in December 2019, with patients presenting with pneumonia of unknown origin. As of March 2, more than 90,000 cases had been confirmed worldwide, including 45,705 cases that ended with patients recovering and more than 3,000 fatalities. On Feb. 28, U.S. health officials confirmed the first known case of the new coronavirus in a patient in the San Francisco Bay Area who had neither traveled abroad nor been exposed to someone known to have traveled to an area affected by the disease (which is called COVID-19). Since then, testing for the new coronavirus has quickly expanded, bringing the known total of cases to 105 in the U.S. Seven people in the U.S. have died from COVID-19.Tracing U.S. spread
Genetic analysis of the virus circulating on the West Coast suggests that COVID-19 has been transmitting through the region for about six weeks. This community spread was not detected earlier for several reasons. First, about 81% of cases do not require hospitalization, according to data from the outbreak in China. People experiencing symptoms such as a mild fever, cough and congestion are unlikely to visit a doctor. Second, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol limited testing to only those with symptoms and a history of travel to an affected region. Finally, there is a lag between virus transmission and fatalities simply because it takes time for the most severe cases to kill. (A World Health Organization report from China found that it took three to six weeks for critical cases to be resolved, either when the patient died or recovered.)What is not yet clear from the U.S. data is how many people have been infected with the new coronavirus. This number is key for understanding disease severity and the mortality rate — after all, you must know the total number of cases to know what proportion of patients will become severely ill or die. China's best data so far puts the case-fatality rate at 2.3%. But that number may drop with better detection of mild and asymptomatic cases. Scientists expect to know more about this number in the coming weeks. Broader testing will help, Paul Biddinger, the vice chairman for emergency preparedness in the emergency medicine department of Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health webcast on March 2. However, testing in the next days to weeks will still likely be limited to a subset of the sickest patients, Biddinger said.""We have, right now, so few tests available that we have to prioritize testing for severe illness,"" he said in the webcast.The weapons of public health. Another method of ferreting out new coronavirus cases is looking at existing influenza and respiratory illness surveillance. This is the bread-and-butter work of public health, said Jennifer Horney, the director of the epidemiology program at the University of Delaware. Most states have what's called ""syndromic surveillance,"" in which emergency rooms, emergency medical services, poison control centers and other medical centers report occurrences of influenza-like symptoms. Washington state, for example, uses the Rapid Health Information Network (RHINO) to collect data in near real time.Most states also have specific flu-monitoring networks, which gather reports of diagnosed influenza cases, usually on a weekly basis. All of this is information that state health departments can use to search for hints of undiagnosed COVID-19. ""They'll be able to go back and see, Did we have more than a typical number of influenza-like illnesses, given what we know now?"" Horney told Live Science.The number of cases it takes to raise the alarm depends on the infectious agent, the time of year and the population in a region, Horney said. In a large city like Seattle in the middle of winter, it might take hundreds of extra cases to raise the alarm, but in a less populous area in at the end of the season, it could take just a handful. 
Already, researchers are seeking out coronavirus cases in a more active way. The Seattle Flu Study, which uses genetic sequencing to track the transmission of seasonal influenza, has begun testing its samples for possible coronavirus as well as flu. The team has already reported finding a case of coronavirus in a Snohomish County high school student who had tested negative for the flu and who had been sent home to recover from mild respiratory symptoms. Public health researchers will also seek out cases based on interviews, similar to the way epidemiologists track an outbreak of foodborne illness, Horney said. As cases emerge, researchers reach out to hospitals and clinics in the affected area, searching for patients with telltale symptoms who were not diagnosed at the time of treatment. They can then interview those people to find out everywhere they've been and everyone they've interacted with. In the case of salmonella, a pattern might pop out: Everyone's eaten the same bagged spinach, or the same brand of fruit cup. In the case of COVID-19, the researchers might find that people with symptoms frequented the same stores or worked in the same office park. Already, the Washington state health department has monitoring contacts of the people already confirmed to have the coronavirus. ""If we find that shared exposure, then we can link all those cases, regardless of severity,"" Horney said.Pyramid of cases. Tracking people with symptoms — whether mild, moderate or severe — is only the beginning, however. One big question about the new coronavirus is how many people transmit COVID-19 without showing symptoms at all, or showing so few symptoms they hardly realize they are sick, Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in the March 2 webcast. Asymptomatic carriers and people with mild symptoms may be like the base of the iceberg, Lipsitch said. They're hard to detect, but they're very important for modeling how the disease will spread.""When we model transmission and when we project how many people are going to get infected, the models don't know how many people are 'sick' or 'really sick,' they know how many are infected"" regardless of severity, Lipsitch said. Scientists in China have already started doing studies that look for antibodies to the virus in people's blood, Lipsitch said. These studies are the only surefire way to confirm that someone has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 after the person recovers. The research will take time, but the more researchers know about the speed of the disease's spread, the more they'll be able to say about the likely length of the outbreak.""What ultimately brings an epidemic under control,"" Lipsitch said, ""is most people in the population becoming immune."" ",1
"""Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser,"" CDC says.As the coronavirus outbreak continues to accelerate in the U.S., cleaning supplies are disappearing off the shelves and people are worried about every subway rail, kitchen counter and toilet seat they touch.But how long can the new coronavirus linger on surfaces, anyway? The short answer is, we don't know. A new analysis found that the virus can remain viable in the air for up to 3 hours, on copper for up to 4 hours, on cardboard up to 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel up to 72 hours. This study was originally published in the preprint database medRxiv on March 11,  and now a revised version was published March 17 in The New England Journal of Medicine. What's more, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found on ""a variety of surfaces"" in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic people who were infected with COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, up to 17 days after the passengers disembarked, according to a new analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, this was before disinfection procedures took place and ""data cannot be used to determine whether transmission occurred from contaminated surfaces,"" according to the analysis. In other words, it's not clear if the viral particles on these surfaces could have infected people.
Another study published in February in The Journal of Hospital Infection analyzed several dozen previously published papers on human coronaviruses (other than the new coronavirus) to get a better idea of how long they can survive outside of the body. They concluded that if this new coronavirus resembles other human coronaviruses, such as its ""cousins"" that cause SARS and MERS, it can stay on surfaces —  such as metal, glass or plastic — for as long as nine days (In comparison, flu viruses can last on surfaces for only about 48 hours.But some of them don't remain active for as long at temperatures higher than 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius). The authors also found that these coronaviruses can be effectively wiped away by household disinfectants. For example, disinfectants with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) can ""efficiently"" inactivate coronaviruses within a minute, according to the study. ""We expect a similar effect against the 2019-nCoV,"" the researchers wrote, referring to the new coronavirus. But even though the new coronavirus is a similar strain to the SARS coronavirus, it's not clear if it will behave the same.Diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions containing at least 70% alcohol and most EPA-registered common household disinfectants should be effective at disinfecting surfaces against the coronavirus, according to the CDC. The bleach solution can be prepared by mixing 5 tablespoons (one-third cup) of bleach per gallon of water or 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water, the CDC wrote in a set of recommendations.However, ""never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser,"" the CDC said. Mixing common cleaners together can create toxic fumes, according to a previous Live Science report. For example, when bleach is mixed with an acidic solution, a chemical reaction produces chlorine gas, which can cause irritation of the eyes, throat and nose. At high concentrations, that gas can cause breathing difficulties and fluid in the lungs, and at very high concentrations it can lead to death, according to the report.It's possible that a person can be infected with the virus by touching a contaminated surface or object, ""then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""But this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."" Though the virus remains viable in the air, the new study can't say whether people can become infected by breathing it in from the air,  according to the Associated Press. The virus is most likely to spread from person to person through close contact and respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes that can land on a nearby person's mouth or nose, according to the CDC.If a person in a household is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, ""clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas,"" according to the CDC's recommendations. Common household areas include tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remotes, handles, desks, toilets and sinks.
What's more, ""As much as possible, an ill person should stay in a specific room and away from other people in their home,"" they wrote. The caregiver should try to stay away from the ill person as much as possible; this means the ill person, if possible, should clean and disinfect surfaces themselves. If that's not possible, the caregiver should wait ""as long as practical"" after an ill person uses the bathroom to clean and disinfect surfaces, according to the CDC. ",1
"When would you know you have the virus?COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, has spread to every continent except Antarctica. Not too long after the virus was first discovered at the end of December, labs turned their sights toward treatment.Currently, however, there is no cure for this coronavirus, and treatments are based on the kind of care given for influenza (seasonal flu) and other severe respiratory illnesses, known as ""supportive care,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These treatments essentially treat the symptoms, which often in the case of COVID-19 involve fever, cough and shortness of breath. In mild cases, this might simply mean rest and fever-reducing medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) for comfort.
In hospitals, doctors and nurses are sometimes treating COVID-19 patients with the antiviral drug oseltamivir, or Tamiflu, which seems to suppress the virus' reproduction in at least some cases. This is somewhat surprising, Michigan Tech virologist Ebenezer Tumban told Live Science, as Tamiflu was designed to target an enzyme on the influenza virus, not on coronaviruses. The National Institutes of Health has begun a clinical trial at the University of Nebraska Medical Center to test the antiviral remdesivir for COVID-19, the agency announced Feb. 25. In China, doctors are also testing an array of other antivirals originally designed to treat Ebola and HIV, Nature Biotechnology reported.In cases in which pneumonia inhibits breathing, treatment involves ventilation with oxygen. Ventilators blow air into the lungs through a mask or a tube inserted directly into the windpipe. A New England Journal of Medicine study of 1,099 hospitalized patients with the coronavirus in China found that 41.3% needed supplemental oxygen and 2.3% needed invasive mechanical ventilation. Glucocorticoids were given to 18.6% of patients, a treatment often used to reduce inflammation and help open airways during respiratory disease.There is no vaccine for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Scientists are working to develop one, Hilary Marston, a medical officer and policy advisor at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said in a Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health webcast on Monday (March 2). As of March 14, doctors in Seattle are recruiting volunteers to participate in a clinical trial for an experimental vaccine for COVID-19 that's being developed by the biotechnology company Moderna Therapeutics. However, biomedical ethicists are concerned that a critical step in vaccine development was skipped. In order to fast-track the vaccine, the researchers didn’t first show that it triggered an immune response in animals, a step that is normally required before human testing, Live Science previously reported.The researchers did begin testing the experimental vaccine on lab mice on the same day they started recruiting people for the clinical trial, Stat News reported. The mice did show an immune response that was similar to the one triggered by an experimental vaccine for a related coronavirus MERS-CoV. (Vaccines work by priming your immune system to recognize a virus like SARS-CoV-2 as an enemy and put up an attack against it.)Even so, doctors aren't sure how much this ""fast-tracking"" will speed up the time it takes to develop and bring such a vaccine to market. Before this experimental vaccine was in the works, Marston had said not to expect a vaccine in the near term. ""If everything moves as quickly as possible, the soonest that it could possibly be is about one-and-a-half to two years. That still might be very optimistic,"" Marston said.Coronavirus basics. The novel coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2, causes the disease COVID-19. The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31, 2019, though it seems to have been spreading well before that date. Since then, it has spread to every continent except Antarctica. The death rate appears to be higher than that of the seasonal flu, but it also varies by location as well as a person's age, underlying health conditions, among other factors. For instance, in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, the death rate reached 2.9%, whereas it was just 0.4% in other provinces in China, according to a study published Feb. 18 in the China CDC Weekly.Scientists aren't certain where the virus originated, though they know that coronaviruses (which also include SARS and MERS) are passed between animals and humans. Research comparing the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with a viral database suggests it originated in bats. Since no bats were sold at the seafood market in Wuhan at the disease’s epicenter, researchers suggest an intermediate animal, possibly the pangolin (an endangered mammal) is responsible for the transmission to humans. There are currently no treatments for the disease, but labs are working on various types of treatments, including a vaccine. ",1
"Research so far indicates that COVID-19 spreads more easily and has a higher death rate than the flu.Since the new coronavirus was first discovered in January, many people have compared it with a more well-known disease: The flu.Many of these comparisons pointed to the perhaps underappreciated toll of the flu, which causes millions of illnesses and tens of thousands of deaths every year in the U.S. alone. (During the current flu season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there have been 39 million to 56 million flu illnesses and 24,000 to 62,000 flu deaths in the U.S., although that number is an estimate based on hospitalizations with flu symptoms, not based on actually counting up every person who has died of flu.The new coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has caused more than 1.4 million illnesses and 85,000 deaths in the U.S. as of May 14, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Both COVID-19 and the flu are respiratory illnesses. But COVID-19 is not the flu. Research so far indicates that COVID-19 spreads more easily and has a higher death rate than the flu.Scientists are racing to find out more about COVID-19, and our understanding may change as new information becomes available. Based on what we know so far, here's how it compares with the flu.Symptoms and severity.Both seasonal flu viruses (which include influenza A and influenza B viruses) and COVID-19 are contagious viruses that cause respiratory illness. Typical flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, headaches, runny or stuffy nose, fatigue and, sometimes, vomiting and diarrhea, according to the CDC. Flu symptoms often come on suddenly. Most people who get the flu will recover in less than two weeks. But in some people, the flu causes complications, including pneumonia. The overall hospitalization rate in the U.S. for flu this season is about 69 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, according to the CDC.With COVID-19, doctors are still trying to understand the full picture of disease symptoms and severity. Reported symptoms in patients have varied from mild to severe, and can include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the CDC. Other symptoms may include fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and new loss of taste or smell. COVID-19 symptoms appear to come on more gradually than those of flu, according to Healthline.
Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions, including heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, appear to be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19, compared with people in younger age groups and those without underlying conditions.The overall hospitalization rate for COVID-19 in the U.S. is about 50 hospitalizations per 100,000 people as of May 8, although the hospitalization rate for adults ages 65 and older is higher, at 162 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, according to the CDC. (However, because fewer people have likely gotten COVID-19 in the U.S. than have gotten the flu, the odds of becoming hospitalized if you have a confirmed case of COVID-19 are thought to be higher than the odds of being hospitalized with influenza.Children are a high risk group for complications from flu, but this doesn't seem to be the case for COVID-19 — few children have been hospitalized with the new coronavirus. A study of COVID-19 cases in the United States published March 18 found that, among 4,226 reported cases, at least 508 people (12%) were hospitalized, and of these, less than 1% were younger than 20 years old. But recently, COVID-19 has been linked to a rare but serious inflammatory syndrome in children, called  pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. New York City has confirmed 100 cases of the syndrome in children, according to The New York Times.It's important to note that, because respiratory viruses cause similar symptoms, it can be difficult to distinguish different respiratory viruses based on symptoms alone, according to the World Health Organization.Death rate. The death rate from seasonal flu is typically around 0.1% in the U.S., according to news reports.Though the death rate for COVID-19 is unclear, almost all credible research suggests it is much higher than that of the seasonal flu.It's important to note that there is no one death rate for COVID-19; the rate can vary by location, age of person infected and the presence of underlying health conditions, Live Science previously reported.Among reported COVID-19 cases in the U.S., nearly 6% have died. This is what's known as the case fatality rate, which is determined by dividing the number of deaths by the total number of confirmed cases. But the case fatality rate is limited for a few reasons. First, not everyone with COVID-19 is being diagnosed with the disease — this is in part due to testing limitations in the U.S. and the fact that people who experience mild or moderate symptoms may not be eligible for or seek out testing. As the number of confirmed cases goes up, the fatality rate may decrease.Researchers from Columbia University recently estimated that only 1 in 12 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. are documented, which they said would translate to an infection fatality rate of about 0.6%, according to The Washington Post. But even this lower estimate is still at least six times higher than that of the flu. (The case fatality rate in people who become sick with flu may be 0.1%, but when you account for people who become infected with flu but never show symptoms, the death rate will be half or even a quarter of that, the Post reported.What's more, unlike the flu, for which there is a vaccine, everyone in the population is theoretically susceptible to COVID-19. So while the flu affects 8% of the U.S. population every year, according to the CDC, between 50% and 80% of the population could be infected with COVID-19, according to a study published March 30 in the journal The Lancet. In the  U.S., that would translate to 1 million deaths from COVID-19 if half the population becomes infected and there are no social distancing measures or therapeutics, the Post reported.Advertisement. Another limitation with the case fatality rate is that some people who are counted as confirmed cases may eventually die from the disease, which would lead to an increase in the death rate. For example, South Korea initially reported a case fatality rate of 0.6% in early March, but it later rose to 1.7% by the beginning of April, according to New Scientist.It's also important to note that estimates of flu illnesses and deaths from the CDC are just that — estimates (which make certain assumptions) rather than raw numbers. (The CDC does not know the exact number of people who become sick with or die from the flu each year in the U.S. Rather, this number is estimated based on data collected on flu hospitalizations through surveillance in 13 states.) A recent paper published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine emphasized this point when it found that, in the U.S., there were 20 times more deaths per week from COVID-19 than from the flu in the deadliest week of an average influenza season, Live Science previously reported.Virus transmission. The measure scientists use to determine how easily a virus spreads is known as the ""basic reproduction number,"" or R0 (pronounced R-nought). This is an estimate of the average number of people who catch the virus from a single infected person, Live science previously reported. The flu has an R0 value of about 1.3, according to The New York Times.Researchers are still working to determine the R0 for COVID-19.  Preliminary studies estimated an R0 value for the new coronavirus to be between 2 and 3, according to a review study published Feb. 28 in the journal JAMA. This means each infected person has spread the virus to an average of 2 to 3 people.
Some studies suggest COVID-19 has an even higher R0 value. For example, a study published April 7 in the journal Emerging Infectious Disease used mathematical modeling to calculate an R0 of nearly 6 in China.It's important to note that R0 is not a constant number. Estimates can vary by location, depending on such factors as how often people come into contact with each other and the efforts taken to reduce viral spread, Live Science previously reported.Pandemics. Seasonal flu, which causes outbreaks every year, should not be confused with pandemic flu, or a global outbreak of a new flu virus that is very different from the strains that typically circulate. This happened in 2009 with the swine flu pandemic, which is estimated to have infected up to 1.4 billion people and killed between 151,000 and 575,000 people worldwide, according to the CDC. There is no flu pandemic happening currently.On March 11, the WHO officially declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. This is the first time the WHO has declared a pandemic for a coronavirus.Prevention. Unlike seasonal flu, for which there is a vaccine to protect against infection, there is no vaccine for COVID-19. But researchers in the U.S. and around the world are working to develop one.In addition, the flu has several treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including antiviral drugs such as amantadine and rimantadine (Flumadine), and inhibitors of influenza, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). In contrast, the FDA has yet to approve any treatments for COVID-19, although approval for remdesivir, an antiviral initially developed to treat Ebola, is pending.In general, the CDC recommends the following to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, which include both coronaviruses and flu viruses: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; avoid close contact with people who are sick; stay home when you are sick; and clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Wearing cloth face coverings in public and practicing social distancing — or staying at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from other people — is also recommended to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",1
"We still don't fully understand how the new coronavirus spreads, but we're learning more every day.The new coronavirus has upended all of our usual calculus about seemingly ordinary activities. Is running past someone on the street safe? How about shopping in a grocery store with a 6-foot (2 meters) distance? And what about packages and takeout? And which of these activities poses the biggest risk?Unfortunately, there's a lot we still don't know about the way the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads.""At this point, I don't think anyone can take a group of people with COVID, say how each person has become infected, and then say that xx% got infected with droplets and yy% got infected via touching surfaces,"" Dr. Jeffrey N. Martin, a professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, told Live Science in an email. ""I don't think this kind of study has ever been done for any infection. In most individual persons, we do not know how the person got infected.""Respiratory transmission. While the basic outlines of disease transmission have not been upended by COVID-19, there are some nuances that could play an important role in the spread of the disease. From the beginning, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have said that SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, and as such, it is mainly transmitted between people through ""respiratory droplets"" when symptomatic people sneeze or cough. This idea, that large droplets of virus-laden mucus are the primary mode of transmission, guides the CDC's advice to maintain at least a 6-foot distance between you and other people. The thinking is that gravity causes those large droplets (which are bigger than about .0002 inches, or 5 microns, in size) to fall to the ground within a distance of 6 feet from the infected person.
But that 6-foot guideline is more of a ballpark estimate than a hard and fast rule, said Josh Santarpia, the research director of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Program at the University of Nebraska's National Strategic Research Institute.""There really isn't anything magic about standing 6 feet away from someone that you are interacting with directly. If you stand talking to someone who is infected with the virus, whether it's 3 feet or 6 feet, there is going to be some risk of infection,"" Santarpia told Live Science in an email. That's because even large respiratory droplets can travel fairly far if the airflow conditions are right, Santarpia said.And some experts believe the 6-foot rule is based on outdated information.""6 feet is probably not safe enough. The 3-6 foot rule is based on a few studies from the 1930s and 1940s, which have since been shown to be wrong — droplets can travel farther than 6 feet,"" said Raina MacIntyre, a principal research fellow and professor of global biosecurity, who heads the Biosecurity Program at the Kirby Institute, in Australia. ""Yet hospital infection control experts continue to believe this rule. It's like the flat Earth theory — anyone who tries to discuss the actual evidence is shouted down by a chorus of believers.”Another complicating factor is that at least 25% of the people who are transmitting the virus may be asymptomatic at the time, said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Live Science previously reported. That suggests coughs and sneezes aren't necessary to transmit the virus, though it's not clear whether simply breathing spreads the virus, or whether talking is required.Aerosol transmission
In order for the virus to be spread without being coughed or sneezed in large drops of mucus, it has to somehow be able to suspend in the air for long enough to infect passersby. And that’s another complicating factor in figuring out transmission: People emit virus particles in a range of sizes, and some are small enough to be considered aerosols, or fine particles that can stay suspended in the air for hours and can travel with air currents across tens of feet. A study published March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that virus particles that were aerosolized could remain viable for up to 3 hours.What's not clear from this data is whether the virus is commonly transmitted via aerosols, or how long the virus remains infectious in aerosols in real-world settings. In that study, researchers used an extremely high concentration of virus particles, which may not reflect those shed by people with the disease.
""To my knowledge, there is no definitive evidence of transmission where aerosol was the only possible route,"" Santarpia told Live Science. For instance, even someone who's not sneezing may emit respiratory droplets when talking, because people may spit when talking, and those droplets could be deposited on surfaces.One case study is suggestive however; a choir group in Skagit, Washington, met for a two-hour practice in early March. No one was symptomatic, so singers weren’t coughing or sneezing out infected droplets. And everyone kept their distance. But when all was said and done, 45 people became infected with COVID-19 and at least two people died from the virus, the Los Angeles Times reported. That suggested the viral particles were shed as aerosols by someone, before being inhaled or otherwise acquired by other choir members. A 2019 study in the journal Nature Scientific Reports found that people emit more aerosol particles when talking, and that louder speech volumes correlate to more aerosol particles being emitted. Fight against online child sexual abuse this National Children’s Day with the National Crime.That case, along with those studies, suggest that the virus can be routinely transmitted via aerosols, though other routes of transmission (such as large droplets being emitted during singing or speech) are still possible explanations. In the 2003 SARS outbreak, aerosol transmission occurred during hospital procedures that generated large volumes of aerosols, such as intubation. Contact transmission.There's one other route that's thought to play a role in the spread of COVID-19: contact transmission. In that situation, viral particles emitted from the respiratory tract of an infected individual land on a surface. Then, another person touches that object, then touches their nose, mouth or eyes. The virus then sneaks into the body via the mucous membranes, infecting the second person. So far, no one knows how common this mode of transmission is, but it does seem to be possible. One study found that SARS-CoV-2 could remain viable on surfaces such as cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for 2 to 3 days. Santarpia has studied viral surface contamination in the context of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. In that study, which was published March 26 on the preprint database medRxiv, Santarpia and his colleagues found viral contamination in air samples, on surfaces such as toilets, and on frequently touched surfaces. Also on March 26, the CDC published a report on the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship. An investigative team found traces of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces throughout the cruise ship, in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers, up to 17 days later — though no evidence suggests this viral RNA was still infectious. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, meaning its main genetic material is RNA, not DNA. Another case report published by the CDC — this time from Singapore — also suggests contact with contaminated surfaces can transmit the virus. In that case, a person who was infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not yet symptomatic, attended a church service. Later in the day, another person sat in the same seat, and also came down with COVID-19. Whether the virus was contracted via a contaminated surface, or potentially a lingering aerosol, however, couldn't be ascertained.
Is food safe?So far, there's no evidence that the virus is transmitted via food. The virus will not live long in food proper, and while it's possible that food packaging from groceries or takeout could contain small concentrations of virus particles, it is easy to mitigate this risk by washing your hands after handling groceries or takeout,Ben Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University, previously told Live Science.Related: How to shop for groceries during the COVID-19 pandemic.The takeaway?The fact that so many seemingly innocuous activities can transmit the virus can be scary. And it can be even scarier not knowing the actual risks associated with each transmission route — without that information, how can we take the right steps to protect ourselves?But ultimately, there's some reassurance in the data as well.""What is true is that persons who have a member of their household infected with the virus have a higher probability of getting infected with COVID than people who do not have a member of their household infected. This tells us a lot. This tells us that close contact is the most important factor,"" Martin said.Briefly passing a person on the street, at a distance of 6 feet, is likely to pose a low risk of infection, Martin said. Chatting at a distance of 6 feet with that same person for a few hours will be higher risk, he said. Ultimately, social distancing is a powerful tool to cut all the hypothesized routes of transmission, experts said.""If the other person is shedding virus into the air, the longer you stand near them, the greater the chance you have to be exposed to the virus,"" Linsey Marr, who studies the transport of air pollutants in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Virginia Tech, told Live Science.",1
"The CDC has said we need to prepare for a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. How? With novel coronavirus outbreaks popping up throughout the world, U.S. health officials on Tuesday (Feb. 25) advised the American public to prepare for an epidemic in which the virus rapidly spreads to many people within a short window of time.""Now's the time for businesses, hospitals, community schools and everyday people to begin preparing,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said in a news conference held Feb. 25. With no vaccine or treatment available to combat these infections, Americans must be prepared to take other precautions to protect themselves and their communities from the virus, she said.""If we're not able to hold the line in the next week or two, you're going to start seeing a lot more cases,"" said Dr. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco. But what can you do, personally, to prepare for an impending viral outbreak? Live Science talked to several experts about how to prepare for coronavirus in the US. Here are some tips:Practice good hygiene and health habits.Wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (with at least 60% to 95% alcohol).Cover your coughs and sneezes with an elbow sleeve or tissue. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, as you can pick up the virus that way. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects like doorknobs and countertops. Evidence suggests that disinfectants with 62% to 71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) can ""efficiently"" inactivate coronaviruses within a minute, though it's not yet known how the new coronavirus reacts to these products, Live Science previously reported.Get the flu shot if you haven't already! Although the seasonal flu vaccine cannot protect you from COVID-19 directly, you may be more likely to develop severe pneumonia if you contract both diseases simultaneously, The New York Times reported. By avoiding the flu, you may also avoid making a trip to the doctor in the middle of a COVID-19 epidemic, when health care workers may be overwhelmed with other patients. Be prepared to stay home.Talk with your employer about what the company's work-from-home and sick leave policy might be in the event of an outbreak.Schools may be closed in your area during an outbreak. Ask your child's school, local school board or health department about how much advance notice there might be preceding a closure. Plan for how you will handle child care if schools and day care centers are closed.Large group gatherings may be canceled, including concerts, religious services and public events. Keep up with local announcements to find out about those cancellations.If you or someone in your household regularly takes prescription drugs, it may be wise to ask your health care and insurance providers about procuring an emergency supply.Make a plan for how to care for those at greater risk of serious illness and hospitalization, such as those over 65 years old and those with preexisting health conditions. Also have a backup plan for who will care for your dependents if you get sick, personally. Make sure you have reasonable amounts of groceries and other basic household necessities, such as laundry detergent. However, it's a balance: ""On the one hand, your chance of exposure will be minimal if you stay home, but if the cost of that is runs on grocery stores and having nothing available, that's a problem,"" Rutherford said.Check in with your neighbors and loved ones. Talk with your neighbors to check in on their health status and see how you can help each other if one of you is home sick or caring for others. Share the newest information from local health authorities, and make sure others are up to date.What to do if you or a household member has symptoms of COVID-19.If you are experiencing high fever, weakness, lethargy, or shortness of breath or have underlying conditions, you should seek medical attention at the nearest hospital, according to Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""The older you are, the shorter the fuse you should have for seeking care,"" Rutherford added. Infants should also be taken to a health care center if they have a fever or are breathing rapidly.
Health care centers may establish triage tents or separate entrances for those with suspected COVID-19 infections, Adalja said. It may be wise to call ahead to learn if this is the case, and what you should do when you get to the hospital.If you live with an infected person, you may be asked to voluntarily quarantine yourself at home to prevent the possible spread of the infection to others, according to the Seattle Public Health Insider.If you have to leave your home (to seek medical care, for example), wearing a medical face mask can help reduce your chance of infecting others. If you don't have a mask, make sure to cover your coughs and sneezes with an elbow sleeve or tissue.What to do if you are healthy, but have to go outside in an affected area. Wearing a standard medical mask can't protect you from COVID-19, as they are not designed to lock out viral particles, Live Science previously reported. However, if you suspect you may have been exposed to the virus, you might consider wearing a mask as a courtesy to others. In crowded spaces, creating distance between yourself and others can help reduce your risk of person-to-person infection, according to the Seattle Public Health Insider. Officials recommend standing at least 3 feet away from nearby persons, but if an epidemic proves more severe, the recommended distance may be increased.",1
"The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown microbial etiology associated with Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on 31 December 2019. The WHO later announced that a novel coronavirus had been detected in samples taken from these patients. Since then, the epidemic has escalated and rapidly spread around the world, with the WHO first declaring a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and then formally declaring it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Clinical trials and investigations to learn more about the virus, its origin, how it affects humans, and its management are ongoing.A potentially severe acute respiratory infection caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).The clinical presentation is generally that of a respiratory infection with a symptom severity ranging from a mild common cold-like illness, to a severe viral pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome that is potentially fatal. Characteristic symptoms include fever, cough, and dyspnea, although some patients may be asymptomatic. Complications of severe disease include, but are not limited to, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.",1
"This is about the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak that began in China in late 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a pandemic. This means that it has spread across the world. This virus can cause a severe lung infection, and it can cause death. You can use our information to talk with your doctor if you are concerned about COVID-19.",1
"COVID-19 is a disease caused by a type of virus called a coronavirus. This is a common type of virus that affects both animals and humans. Coronaviruses often cause symptoms like those of the common cold. But sometimes they can cause more serious infections.The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus. Most of the first people affected had links to a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,China. This suggests that this new coronavirus might be a combination of human and animal coronaviruses.The virus has now spread to over 100 countries. The US, Spain, Italy, France, the UK,Germany, Turkey, Russia and Brazil have reported the most cases.",1
"COVID-19 is able to spread from person to person. The virus seems to spread when people cough or sneeze, and when people touch objects and surfaces that have the virus on them.The virus can survive for up to 24 hours on cardboard and for up to three days on stainless steel and plastic. Infected people can spread this virus even if they don't have any symptoms yet.You are more likely to catch the infection if: you live in, or have travelled to, an area where COVID-19 has been reported, you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you are having treatment for cancer, you are older. you are male, you are obese, you have chronic kidney disease",1
"It's thought that people can have the virus for up to 14 days without having any symptoms.This time before symptoms develop is called the incubation period.Most people who catch COVID-19 will have an illness like a bad cold or flu. Some people will have a more severe illness, like pneumonia.You’re more likely to have a severe illness if: you are older, you live in a nursing home or care home, you are male, you are obese, you are a smoker, you have high blood pressure, you have diabetes, you have cardiovascular disease (a condition affecting your heart or your blood vessels,e.g. heart attack, stroke, heart failure, angina), you have a disease affecting your lungs (e.g. asthma, COPD). you have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, you have cancer, you have had an organ transplant, you are recovering from surgery. Children seem to be infected with corona virus less frequently than adults. Most children who catch COVID-19 have had close contact with an infected person.The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are: fever, coughing, shortness of breath, loss of sense of smell, and reduced sense of taste,Less common symptoms can include: aches and pains, feeling tired, diarrhoea, feeling nauseous or vomiting, abdominal (tummy) pain, loss of appetite, coughing up a lot of phlegm, sore throat, confusion, dizziness, blocked or runny nose, conjunctivitis (red or watery eyes), headache, skin rashes, and coughing up blood.COVID-19 can also cause sepsis. This is when the body’s immune system reacts badly to an infection and attacks the body. It affects about 5 in 100 people with COVID-19. The symptoms of sepsis include: fever, a fast heartbeat, confusion not needing to urinate as much as usual, and mottled, patchy skin. There have been reports of COVID-19 causing a severe illness in children, with a fever lasting more than five days, a rash, swollen glands in the neck, red fingers or toes and dry, cracked lips. This is very rare but if you have concerns about your child, it’s very important to speak to a doctor as soon as possible. As you can see, many of the less serious symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of a bad cold or flu. So it can be hard to diagnose COVID-19 without testing. If your doctor thinks that you might have COVID-19, you might need some tests, such as collecting a sample from your nose or mouth, blood tests, a chest x-ray, or another type of scan of your chest called a CT (computed tomography) scan.Some people who are seriously ill with COVID-19 can develop problems with their kidneys,liver, heart or brain. If this happens, you might need more tests and extra care.Pregnant and breastfeeding women. We don't know for certain whether the virus can pass from a mother who is infected to her baby in the womb, or to a baby through breastfeeding. The symptoms of COVID-19 during pregnancy are the same as in people who are not pregnant. If you are pregnant and you develop symptoms, you should contact your doctor straight away. You might need regular ultrasound scans during your pregnancy if you have had COVID-19. And you and your baby might need extra monitoring during labour and after giving birth.Some countries, such as the UK, recommend that pregnant women should follow strict social distancing measures",1
"You can take measures to reduce your risk of catching the infection. These include: washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in a public place. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser containing at least 60% alcohol, avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces every day, including counter tops,phones, light switches, handles and door knobs, avoid close contact with people who are sick. The recommended distance between people varies between countries. For example, 2 metres (6 feet) is recommended in the US and UK.You should avoid all non-essential travel to the worst affected countries. Some countries have introduced complete travel bans. If you have to travel to a country or region that is badly affected, you are advised to: avoid close contact with anyone who has symptoms of a chest or throat infection, such as a fever or cough, wash your hands often, especially after direct contact with people, avoid eating raw or undercooked animal products avoid close contact with live or dead farm or wild animals.You should follow any national or regional policies on social distancing. Depending on where you live, this may include: cancelling or limiting the size of public gatherings, not attending schools and universities, not visiting cafes, bars, restaurants, and other businesses, working from home if possible, only leaving the house for essential journeys, for example to buy food or medicine not letting your pet interact with people and animals outside your household. At this time, there is no evidence that pets and other animals can spread COVID-19 but caution is advised. Cats can become infected with coronavirus after contact with people who have COVID-19. Scientists are carrying out research in this area. If you become ill, you should:stay home and avoid contact with other people seek medical care right away. But call ahead to your doctor or emergency department and tell them about your symptoms not travel while you are unwell cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing, then put the tissue into the bin wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose or being in a public place. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser containing at least 60% alcohol, limit contact with pets and other animals. At this time, there is no evidence that pets and other animals can spread COVID-19 but caution is advised. Cats can become infected with coronavirus after contact with people who have COVID-19. Some people wear medical masks to try to protect themselves against the infection. Recommendations about wearing masks vary between countries. The World Health Organization recommends that you should wear a mask if you are a healthcare worker or if you are caring for someone with COVID-19 at home. If you choose to wear a mask, you should wash your hands with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser,before putting on the mask. You will still need to wash your hands often and thoroughly while wearing the mask. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that there is likely to be a very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures. The UK government advises it is very unlikely that you can catch coronavirus from food. You should follow good hygiene and preparation practices when handling and eating raw fruit, leafy salads and vegetables, such as washing fresh produce to help to remove any contamination on the surface and peeling the outer layers or skins of certain fruits and vegetables.Travel restrictions and policies. Travel restrictions and other quarantine measures have been introduced to try to stop the spread of the virus. Many countries advise against all non-essential travel and many flights have been cancelled. Some countries have arranged for all their citizens to leave the worst affected areas and to be quarantined for about two weeks on their return. Travel advice is changing rapidly and you should check the latest advice from the government in your country before planning a trip.Many countries have introduced other measures to try to slow down the spread of the virus.For example, people have been asked to work from home if possible, and some countries have closed schools and other public places.",1
"There is no cure for COVID-19. A vaccine is being developed, but it will be some time before it is available. Different medicines are being tested to see whether they can help patients with COVID-19. The research is in the early stages, so these medicines are normally. only given as part of a clinical trial. A drug called remdesivir may be used in patients who have severe COVID-19. Other drugs that are being investigated are called chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Another treatment is being developed from the blood of people who have recovered from COVID-19. Their blood contains proteins called antibodies, which can stick to the virus that causes COVID-19 and help to fight the infection. This treatment is called convalescent plasma.Hospital treatment. The treatment for someone with COVID-19 is the same as for pneumonia or any other serious viral chest infection.If you are treated in hospital, the treatment will consist of: rest, making sure you get plenty of fluids, possibly through an IV (intravenous) drip, medication to lower fever and reduce pain, if needed oxygen, if you need it, and close monitoring. You might also be given antibiotics to begin with, in case you have a bacterial infection. But if testing shows that you have a viral infection, the antibiotics will be stopped, as antibiotics don’t work against viruses.People with severe symptoms might be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU). If you need to be treated in intensive care, your treatment might also include:a tube passed through your mouth to your windpipe, called an endotracheal tube, and a ventilator to support your breathing. Some people being treated in hospital might also need treatment for sepsis.Home treatment.In most countries, people who are seriously ill would probably be isolated and treated in hospital.But if someone has mild symptoms of suspected COVID-19, they can probably be looked after at home until they can be tested. For example, in the UK, people who have symptoms are advised not to go to hospital right away, but to stay at home and contact their health authorities, and to follow their advice. This will help stop the spread of the virus.The guidance for looking after them at home is as follows: They should be looked after in a well ventilated room by themselves, and should stay in that room as much as possible, so that they don’t spread the infection. The number of people who look after the ill person should be limited to as few as possible. Ideally, anyone looking after the ill person should be in good health.If you wear a medical mask while looking after someone with symptoms, change it for a new one if it comes into contact with their bodily fluids.Wash your hands thoroughly after touching the ill person. You might want to wear disposable gloves, such as latex gloves.Dispose carefully of any tissues the person uses. Don’t share anything like towels or bedclothes with the ill person. Carefully wash any plates, drinking glasses and cutlery after they use it. Regularly wipe and disinfect any surfaces the person touches regularly, such as bedside tables.Clean toilet and bathroom surfaces regularly.Clean all clothes, bedclothes, and towels used by the ill person at 60 to 90° C. The ill person should limit contact with pets and other animals. At this time, there is no evidence that pets and other animals can spread COVID-19 but caution is advised. Cats. can become infected with coronavirus after contact with people who have COVID-19.Scientists are carrying out research in this area too. Keep taking any prescribed medications, unless your doctor recommends that you stop.The advice might change as we find out more about this virus and how it spreads.If you are looking after someone who might have COVID-19 at home, your whole household might need to stay in isolation for up to 14 days, to reduce the risk of passing on the infection.If you are not sure what to do, contact your doctor for advice.What will happen?It’s not possible to say what will happen to someone infected with COVID-19. The outcome can vary. What we know so far is that: the infection is most likely to be serious in older people with existing long-term health problems. But most people with COVID-19 don't become seriously ill, about 80 in 100 people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, about 20 in 100 people develop more severe symptoms, most people who become ill are middle aged and older, but some young adults have become very ill as well, children are much less likely than adults to become ill, but a few children do become very ill, men are more likely than women to become severely ill. The best thing you can do is to follow the advice about travel restrictions, other prevention measures and about what to do if you feel ill. This will help to protect you and the people around you. During the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors have noticed that fewer people are coming to hospital with serious illnesses like heart attacks or cancers. If you feel unwell, even if you don’t think you have COVID-19, it is very important to get help. Hospitals are still open for other emergencies.If you usually do a lot of exercise, you should rest for at least two weeks after recovering from COVID-19 or testing positive for coronavirus. You should speak to your doctor about when you can start exercising again.",1
"It’s normal to feel worried about coronavirus. This is an uncertain time and you might be feeling bored, lonely, anxious, frustrated or low. It’s important to remember that, for most people, these feelings will pass. Here are some things that you can do to look after your mental health during the coronavirus pandemic: stay connected with friends and family, talk about your worries, carry on doing things you enjoy, keep on getting support for your physical and mental health difficulties, if possible. Lots of healthcare providers are able to offer phone or video appointments. eat healthy meals and drink enough water, exercise regularly, try not to drink too much alcohol, try to maintain a regular sleeping pattern",1
"there is no cure for coronavirus yet, but taking daily doses of 5,000 milligrams of vitamin C and 150,000 IUs of vitamin D for three days could help boost the immune system. also recommended 25,000 IUs of vitamin A a day for two weeks, which is more than twice the upper recommended limit. ",0
"If you have a flu-like disease, I'm just gonna treat you with vitamin C. I'm not gonna swab your nose to see if you have influenza A or B. I don't care, the treatment is actually the same,vitamin C regimen consists of an IV treatment of 15,000 milligrams a day, 166 times the recommended daily amount for men.also offers shots of 100,000 IU vitamin D3 to treat the coronavirus — a dose 160 times the recommended daily dose",0
"recommends 24,000 milligrams of vitamin C or 266 times the Mayo Clinic's daily dose for men. these types of vitamin megadoses can combat viral infections like the flu, a cold, and the coronavirus by strengthening the immune system to prevent people from contracting them altogether.",0
"Here are a few of the main theses conveyed by this documentary:The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the result of human manipulation in the laboratory, The virus was deliberately released outside the Wuhan virology laboratory, The first traces of the virus do not go back to the Wuhan market , SARS-CoV-2 may have been created from the HIV virus",0
"Roger Stone suggested Monday that Bill Gates may have had a hand in the creation of coronavirus so that he could plant microchips in people’s heads to know who has and has not been tested for COVID-19.“Whether Bill Gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate. I have conservative friends who say it’s ridiculous and others say absolutely,” Stone told Joe Piscopo, host of the radio program “The Answer” on 970 AM, who had asked about conspiracy theories regarding the pandemic.“He and other globalists are using it for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people so we know if they’ve been tested. Over my dead body. Mandatory vaccinations? No way, Jose!” Stone told a fawning Piscopo, who referred to President Trump’s longtime adviser as “a legend.”Gates has long been an outspoken advocate for preparing for a global health crisis like coronavirus.",0
"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates will launch human-implantable capsules that have ‘digital certificates’ which can show who has been tested for the coronavirus and who has been vaccinated against it.The 64 year old tech mogul and currently the second richest person in the world, revealed this yesterday during a Reddit ‘Ask Me Anything’ session while answering questions on the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic.Gates was responding to a question on how businesses will be able to operate while maintaining social distancing, and said that, “Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.”The ‘digital certificates’ Gates was referring to are human-implantable ‘QUANTUM-DOT TATTOOS’ that researchers at MIT and Rice University are working on as a way to hold vaccination records. It was last year in December when scientists from the two universities revealed that they were working on these quantum-dot tattoos after Bill Gates approached them about solving the problem of identifying those who have not been vaccinated.The quantum-dot tattoos involve applying dissolvable sugar-based microneedles that contain a vaccine and fluorescent copper-based ‘quantum dots’ embedded inside biocompatible, micron-scale capsules. After the microneedes dissolve under the skin, they leave the encapsulated quantum dots whose patterns can be read to identify the vaccine that was administered.The quantum-dot tattoos will likely be supplemented with Bill Gates’ other undertaking called ID2020, which is an ambitious project by Microsoft to solve the problem of over 1 billion people who live without an officially recognized identity. ID2020 is solving this through digital identity. Currently, the most feasible way of implementing digital identity is either through smartphones or RFID microchip implants. The latter will be Gates’s likely approach not only because of feasibility and sustainability, but also because for over 6 years, the Gates Foundation has been funding another project that incorporates human-implantable microchip implants. This project, also spearheaded by MIT, is a birth control microchip implant that will allow women to control contraceptive hormones in their bodies.As for ID2020, to see it through, Microsoft has formed an alliance with four other companies, namely; Accenture, IDEO, Gavi, and the Rockefeller Foundation. The project is supported by the United Nations and has been incorporated into the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals initiative.It will be interesting to see how Bill Gates and ID2020 will execute all this because many Christians, and surprisingly a growing number of Shia Muslims, are very opposed to the idea of microchipping and any form of body-invasive identification technology. Some Christian legislators and politicians in the United States have even tried to ban all forms of human microchipping.But, on the other hand, this is Bill Gates’ perfect opportunity to see the projects through because as the coronavirus continues to spread and more people continue to die from the pandemic, the public at large is becoming more open to problem-solving technologies that will contain the spread of the virus.The main reason many Christians and some Shia Muslims are opposed to body-invasive identification technologies, however helpful such technologies are for preventing pandemics, is because they believe that such technologies are the so called ‘Mark of Satan’ mentioned in the Bible and some Mahdi prophecies. In the Book of Revelations in the Bible, anyone who does not have this “mark” is not allowed to buy or sell anything.Last year in November, a Denmark-based tech company which had contracts to produce microchip implants for the Danish Government and the US Navy, had to cancel the launch of its supposedly “revolutionary” Internet-of-Things powered microchip implant after Christian activists attacked its offices in Copenhagen.",0

"A researcher with ties to China was recently escorted out of the National Microbiology Lab (NML) in Winnipeg amid an RCMP investigation into what’s being described as a possible “policy breach.”Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, her husband Keding Cheng and an unknown number of her students from China were removed from Canada’s only level-4 lab on July 5, CBC News has learned. A Level 4 virology facility is a lab equipped to work with the most serious and deadly human and animal diseases. That makes the Arlington Street lab one of only a handful in North America capable of handling pathogens requiring the highest level of containment, such as Ebola.Security access for the couple and the Chinese students was revoked, according to sources who work at the lab and do not want to be identified because they fear consequences for speaking out.Sources say this comes several months after IT specialists for the NML entered Qiu’s office after-hours and replaced her computer. Her regular trips to China also started being denied.Corona virus. A Canadian made pathogen weaponized and leaked by China and named after a Mexican beer. That, is multiculturalism.",0

"By the end of 2020 more people will have died from hunger, despair and suicide than from the corona disease. We, the world, is facing a famine-pandemic of biblical proportions. This real pandemic will overtake the COVID19 pandemic by a long shot. The hunger pandemic reminds of the movie the Hunger Games, as it is premised on similar circumstances of a dominant few commanding who can eat and who will die – by competition.This hunger pandemic will be under-reported or not reported at all in the mainstream media. In fact, it has started already. In the west the attention focuses on the chaos created by the privatized for-profit mismanagement of the health system. It slowly brings to light the gross manipulation in the US of COVID-19 infections and death rates – how hospitals are encouraged to declare deaths as COVID19-deaths – for every COVID19 death-certificate the hospital receives a US$13,000 “subsidy”, and if the patient dies on a ventilator, the “bonus” amounts to US$ 39,000.In real life, poor people cannot live under confinement, under lockdown. Not only have many or most already lost their meager living quarters because they can no longer pay the rent – but they need to scrape together in the outside world whatever they can find to feed their families and themselves. They have to go out and work for food and if there is no work, no income – they may resort to ransacking supermarkets in the city or farms in the country side. Food to sustain life is essential. Taking the opportunity to buy food away from people is sheer and outright murder.“Every child who dies from famine in the world – is a murder” – Jean Ziegler, former UN-Rapporteur on Food in Africa.Yes, the diabolical Masters of Darkness, who invented and launched this COVID19 pandemic –are nothing less than murderers. Mass-murderers, that is. They are committing mass genocide on a worldwide scale in proportions unknown in recent history of human kind. And this to dominate a world under a New World Order, aiming at a massively reduced world population.The self-imposed new rulers decide who will live and who will die. Their self-promoting do-gooder agenda – à la Bill Gates and Co. – professes to reduce world poverty – yes, by killing the poor, by, for example, tainted toxic vaccinations, rendering African women infertile. (The Gates Foundation with support of WHO and UNICEF have a track record of doing so in Kenya and elsewhere, see here  Kenya carried out a massive tetanus vaccination program, sponsored by WHO and UNICEF); or letting the “under-developed”, the already destitute, die by famine – preventing them from access to sufficient food and drinking water. Privatizing water, privatizing even emergency food supplies – is a crime that leads exactly to this: lack of access due to unaffordable pricing.Should this not be enough, “Lock Step” has other solutions to enhance starvation. HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program) can help. HAARP has been perfected and weaponized. According to US Air Force document AF 2025 Final Report, weather modification can be used defensively and offensively, i.e. to create droughts or floods, both of which have the potential of destroying crops – destroying the livelihood of the poor.And if that is not enough, the 2010 Rockefeller Report also foresees food rationing, selectively, of course, as we are talking about eugenics. Let’s not forget Henry Kissinger’s infamous words he uttered in 1970: “Who controls the food supply controls the people – the quote goes on saying, “Who controls the energy can control whole continents; who controls money can control the world.”A recent Facebook entry (name and location not revealed for personal protection) reads as follows:“….. In the poorer country, where I live, the entire village is on lockdown since March 16. Here the people having nothing to eat…… The wife of my main worker was raped and beaten to death. She was of Chinese descent. In spite of not being allowed to go outside, the people were starving and rampaged walking miles from farm to farm destroying everything. I have lost my entire livestock, fruits, vegetables. The houses were burned and the vehicles, tools etc. stolen. I am bankrupt with nobody around who can give money to rebuild. My workers cannot be paid. Their families are also starving. More malnutrition and undernourishment which will lead to a higher starvation rate or death from other diseases. How many will commit suicide through landing on the streets completely impoverished? – How many died in India trying to walk literally up to thousands of miles to get back home in the hope of finding refuge, after all public transportation was shut down and all had to go into lockdown. I am sure that these numbers will be a lot higher than the number who have died from the virus as well as will increase the numbers for those dying of next year’s flue due to a weakened immune system.”And as an afterthought …. “Maybe the elite are planning depopulation. It sure looks like it.”This happened somewhere in the Global South. But the example is representative for much of the Global South, and developing countries in general. And probably much worse is to come, as we are seeing so far only a tiny tip of the iceberg.The International Labor Organization (ILO) reports that worldwide unemployment is reaching never-seen mammoth proportions, that about half of the world’s workforce – 1.6 billion people -may be out of work. That means no income to pay for shelter, food, medication – it means starvation and death. For millions. Especially in the Global South which has basically no social safety nets. People are left to themselves.The New York Times (NYT) reports (1 May 2020) that in the US millions of unemployed go uncounted, as the system cannot cope with the influx of claims. Add these millions to the already reported more than 27 million unemployed, the tally becomes astronomical. The same NYT concludes that the millions who have risen out of poverty since the turn of the century, are likely to fall back into destitution along with millions more.Dying of famine – mostly in the Global South, but not exclusively – is an atrocious death for millions, maybe hundreds of millions. Dying in the gutters of mega-cities, forgotten by society, by the authorities, too weak to even beg, infested with parasites due to lack of hygiene – rotting away alive. This is already happening today in many metropolises, even without the corona disaster. These people are not picked up by any statistics. They are non-people. Period.Imagine – such situations in large cities as well as in rural areas, under plan “Lock Step” (Rockefeller, Kissinger, Gates et al), the death toll would be orders of magnitude higher.The current lockdown – brings everything to halt. Practically worldwide. The longer it lasts the more devastating the social and economic impact will be. Irretrievable. Not only production of goods, services and food – comes to a halt, but vital supply chains to bring products from a to A to B, are interrupted. Workers are not allowed to work. Security. For your own protection. The virus, the invisible enemy could hit you. It could kill you – and your loved-ones too. Fear-Fear-Fear – that’s the moto that works best – it works so well that people start screaming – gimmi, gimmi, gimmi- gimmi a vaccine! – which brings a happy grin on Bill Gates’ face. As he sees the billions rolling and his power rising.Bill Gates along with WHO he bought will become famous. They will save the world from new pandemics – never mind, their side effects – 7 billion people vaccinated (Bill Gates’ wet dream) and nobody has time to care or report about side effects, no matter how deadly they may be. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) may be slated for the Peace Nobel Prize – and, who knows, Bill Gates may become one of the next Presidents of the dying empire. Wouldn’t that be an appropriate reward for the world? Meanwhile the rather cold-blooded IMF maintains its awfully unrealistic prediction of a slight “economic contraction” of the world economy of a mere 3% in 2020, and a slight growth in the second half of 2021. The IMF’s approach to world economics and human development – to social crisis, is fully monetized and lacks any compassion – and thus, becomes utterly irrelevant in the age of corona. Institutions like the IMF and the World Bank, mere extension of the US treasury, they are passé in the face of an economic collapse, for which they are also in part responsible.What they should do – perhaps IMF and WB combined – is call for a capital increase of up to 4 trillion SDRs (as was suggested by some of the IMF Board Members) and use the funds as a special debt relieve fund, a “Debt Jubilee Fund” for Global South Nations. Handed out as grants. This would allow these nations to get back on their feet, back to their sovereign national monetary and economic policies, recovering their internal economy, with a national currency, public banking and a government-owned central bank, creating jobs and internal autonomy in food, health and education.Why is this not happening? – It would require a change in their constitution and a redistribution of voting rights according to new economic strength of nations. China would become a much more important player – with a more important share and decision-making role. Of course, that’s what the US does not want to happen. But the unwillingness to adapt to new realities, makes these institutions irrelevant to the point that they should and might fade away.Interestingly, though, two of the three economic projection scenarios of the IMF, foresee another pandemic, or a new wave of the old pandemic in 2021. What does the IMF know that we don’t?Juxtaposed to the insensitive approach of the global financial institutions and the globalized private banking system, the World Food Program warns (25 April 2020) that the COVID19 pandemic will cause “famines of biblical proportions”; that without urgent action and funding, hundreds of millions of people will face starvation and millions could die as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.As it is, every year about 9 million people die from famine in the world.The WFP Executive Director, David Beasley, told the UN Security Council that in addition to the threat to health posed by the virus, the world faces “multiple famines within a few short months,” which could result in 300,000 deaths per day—a “hunger pandemic.”Beasley added that even before the outbreak, the world was “facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II” this year due to many factors. He cited the wars in Syria and Yemen, the crisis in South Sudan and locust swarms across East Africa. He said that coupled with the coronavirus outbreak, famine threatened about three dozen nations.According to the WFP’s “2020 Global Report on Food Crises” released Monday (20 April ), 135 million people around the world were already threatened with starvation. Beasley said that as the virus spreads, “an additional 130 million people could be pushed to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020. That’s a total of 265 million people.”The famine pandemic is further exacerbated by the ongoing refugee crisis – which is also a catastrophe of misery – hunger, disease, lack of shelter – total lack of hygiene in most of the refugee camps.Professor Jean Ziegler, Sociologist (Universities Geneva and Sorbonne, Paris), Vice-President of the UN Human Rights Committee, recently visited the refugee camp of Moria on the Greek island of Lesbos. He described a situation where 24,000 refugees are cramped into military barracks that were built for 2,800 soldiers, live under calamitous circumstances – lack of potable water, insufficient and often inedible food, clogged and much too few stinking toilets…. diseases no end. COVID19 would just be a sideline.These people who fled Europe-and-western-caused warzones, destroyed livelihoods – are being pushed back by the very European Union, as most countries do not want to host them and give them a chance for a new life. This atrocious xenophobic behavior of Europe is against Human Rights all EU countries signed and against internal EU rules. They are a sad reminder of what Europe really is – a conglomerate of countries with a history of hundreds of years of colonization, of merciless exploitation, plundering and raping of the Global South.This abjectly atrocious characteristic – shamelessly continuing to this day – seems to have become an integral part of the European DNA. These wars and conflicts are willfully US-NATO made, for power, greed – to maintain the US military industrial complex alive and profitable – and as a stepping stone towards total world hegemony.The refugees emanating from these conflict zones, their fate and famine will be added to those starving form the also man-imposed corona crisis. The death toll from sheer hunger and famine-related causes, may become astronomical by the end of 2020, way-way outweighing and dwarfing the doctored and manipulated COVID-19 figures.My final words: follow you heart. Open your heart to love and beyond your five given and media-manipulated senses and enter a higher consciousness. Get out of FEAR, get out of the lockdown, stand up for your rights, for your freedom. Because freedom and liberty cannot be bought with money, nor trampled by the media. They are inherently within us all. If enough of us open our hearts to LOVE, to an all-englobing love, we will overcome this small psychopathic elite.",0
"Professor Nyal Ferguson, on the basis of whose predictions the UK turned its policy 180 degrees and switched from the Swedish version to the most severe quarantine and drones watching dog lovers in the wasteland, predicted 500 thousand corpses in the UK and 2 million corpses in the USA.After, based on all these terrifying predictions and expert assessments, the whole West, not counting Sweden, plunged into a lockdown, antibody tests appeared. And then it became clear how many people actually got sick and what real mortality was.Based on tests, the mortality rate in the county of Santa Clara, California sits between 0.12-0.2%.In the county of Los Angeles, also in California – 0.18-0.36%.In Gangelt, Germany – 0.37%.In the state of New York – 0.58%, and in the city of New York – 0.86%, while 21% of the population there was already ill.And then the Daily Mail comes along and says that the mortality may be up to 8 times higher, not the 3.4% that the World Health Organization estimates, but the 0.5%.And reports such as this that give confusing, and unclear information, but to which a large number of people have access is common.The situation is the same with medication for COVID-19 – on March 19th, US President Donald Trump announced that chloroquine – a well-known, cheap and old cure for malaria – also helps with coronavirus.Prior to that, Elon Musk, who’s quite a well-known proponent of whatever is the flavor of the month, praised it.Elon Musk, in March cited questionable sources, saying that by the end of April there would be close to 0 infections per day in the US, and that people should sit at home.Now, Musk, is riding the high-tide of populism and is calling for “FREE AMERICA NOW.”Elon Musk hit out against the lockdowns that have kept businesses throughout the U.S. closed for more than a month in a series of tweets late Tuesday.Give people their freedom back!” Tesla Inc.’s chief executive officer said as he promoted Wall Street Journal analysis that suggested closures don’t save many lives. “Bravo Texas!” Musk tweeted, highlighting a Texas Tribune story that said the state’s restaurants and other businesses can reopen.Musk also said that he would reopen Tesla’s vehicle-assembly plant near San Francisco. Tesla has been eager to reopen after having clashed with the county and the city of Fremont over whether it was an essential business and could remain open.Essentially, Musk, is attempting to support whatever is popular at the moment, simply to achieve his own agenda to open his businesses, but also be on the side of the popular majority.Dr. Didier Raoult, the famous French infectious disease specialist, creator and director of the Mediterranean University-Clinical Institute of Infectious Diseases, used it for treatment.The results of Dr. Raoult and his institute were outstanding: by the end of March, only 10 of the 2,400 people who received treatment at his institute had died.But, as soon as Trump said it would work, the medication suddenly became worthless and unusable.Nevada Democratic Governor Steve Sisolak immediately banned the use of chloroquine for treating COVID-19 with his order, while Michigan Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer threatened doctors who used the medication with administrative sanctions.As for Dr. Raoult – he was immediately accused of quackery, totalitarianism, and sexual harassment. But to be fair, he said that universal testing was needed and that both choloroquine and azithromycin should be used in the early stages of the disease, and then it was useless to apply them later on.As such, Raoult may have not found the be-all end-all of COVID-19 treatments, but rather found that’s needed – proper testing.Then, the above-mentioned governor’s orders were immediately supported by other studies, claiming that the medication shouldn’t be used.A group of scientists analyzed the medical history of COVID-19 patients in a hospital for American veterans and published a terrifying preprint. 28% of those who received chloroquine died, and among those who did not, only 11% died. And then, the medication from not-very-effective in the later stages, turned into something that kills patients.The thing is that no information was given about the study that’s being propagated, at least Raoult provided some evidence.An additional adverse effect of this study was that chloroquine has been consumed for over 80 years. This is the oldest and well-proven cure for malaria. It is produced in tons. Its wholesale price for Africa is 4 (in words – four) cents. It is included in the WHO list of essential medicines, which includes only the safest and most needed medicines. And it claimed that it kills people.For 80 years, chloroquine has been a cheap, common, safe generic. And only when it turned out that the medicine was priced at 4 cents, it was established that it couldn’t cure COVID-19 because it would potentially be too cheap and accessible.Another promising drug was remdesivir, an Ebola drug developed by Gilead Sciences. And what? On April 23rd, WHO “accidentally” posted on its website test results that showed that remdesivir was no good.The tests were carried out so incorrectly that WHO had to immediately remove the article from the site and even claim that it got there “by mistake”.But the deed was done. Gilead shares crashed. Explanations by its scientists that the WHO-provided clinical trials were incorrect, did not interest anyone.Media informed the whole world that the drug did not work in the “gold standard” trials, and the trials themselves had to be interrupted due to side effects.The trick of all these stories is that trials by all medical rules – double blind randomized – cannot be done at all in an epidemic. And to conduct them is immoral. During the epidemic, the doctor will not leave a whole group of patients without a medicine that, he thinks, can help them, only to check if this medicine works.At the same time, the epidemic removed barriers to the quality of information – and articles and preprints began to appear on professional websites that would never have been reviewed.It’s a Catch-22 situation: any positive news wouldn’t be taken into account because didn’t pass the “double-blind randomized test” while negative news would be immediately shared, because in an epidemic you want to get to the most audience, and it’s easier to believe fearmongering, since the climate itself facilitates it.
And it is possible that the vaccine testing would undergo the same treatment.Many “live” vaccines tend to stimulate the innate immune system and thereby protect not only from the disease from which the vaccine works, but also from a wide range of infections in general.The stimulation mechanism is sufficiently proven and studied.Especially remarkable in this sense is not even the BCG vaccine, but the live polio vaccine, which has been used for a long time in developing countries, where it not only protected against poliomyelitis, but also reduced infant mortality from other infections by 30%.
In the USSR, the same vaccine reduced the incidence of influenza by 75%.This live vaccine, perhaps, could serve as a serious defense throughout, for example, the year and a half, during which the vaccine itself against the virus is being developed. The vaccine costs 10 cents.The famous virologist and founder of the Global Virus Network, Dr. Robert Gallo, best known for his discovery of HIV, announced the start of clinical trials of the polio vaccine against COVID-19.A vaccine that is already ready, which costs 10 cents, which will radically reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, and there are no side effects from it in children – one case in three million, despite what the anti-vaxxers say. WHO – rightly – stated that it does not recommend the use of a live polio vaccine against coronavirus.As the number of antibody tests grew and it became clear that 20-25% of the population was already infected in New York. And there was a danger, of people returning to the streets.And on April 24th, the WHO stated that it is categorically against lifting quarantine for those who have been ill, because it has “no data” that all people develop stable immunity. In some patients, WHO warns, antibody levels are very low, and tests can give a 0-positive result. Therefore, even those who have been ill cannot go to work.So, does that mean that vaccination also doesn’t work? If, according to WHO, even after an illness there is no guarantee that antibodies will be produced, how will they be produced after vaccination?That is, the recommendation by WHO is translated like this: There is no cure for this disease. That is, the WHO, of course, did not check, but there are a couple of preprints saying that there’s no cure, and it cannot ignore such important evidence.Basically, people should sit at home and, more importantly, generally keep quiet.People want to work so as not to starve to death, just call them a fascist.If they raise the question that people without work will get drunk, get on drugs, commit suicide, just call them a fascist, covidiot.If they attempt to timidly stutter that closed hospitals will lead to a monstrous increase in mortality from cancer, from cardiovascular diseases, from diseases of the kidneys, liver, once again, just call them a fascist and covidiot.This isn’t to say that COVID-19 is not a serious pandemic. It is an astounding test of the strength healthcare systems, as seen in France and Italy, which occupy the 1st and 2nd position in the WHO ranking, and of the US, which occupies the 37th position.And Italy and France appear to be passing the test, while the US seems to be failing entirely.All of the listed above paints a very stark picture. This is no longer an attempt to solve a real problem, but rather an attempt to make the problem unsolvable, and the control and power of the bureaucrats is eternal.",0
"The global coronavirus pandemic has enormous geopolitical implications. The world will never be the same again. However, it is premature to speak of what kind of world it will end up being. The outbreak has not passed: we have not even reached the peak. The main unknown points remain: what kind of losses will humanity ultimately suffer - how many deaths? Who will be able to stop the virus from spreading, and how? What are the real consequences for those who have been sick and those who have survived?No one can yet answer these questions even approximately, and therefore we cannot even remotely imagine the real damage. In the worst case scenario, the pandemic will lead to a serious decline in the world's population. At best, the panic will turn out to be premature and groundless. But even after the first months of the pandemic, some global geopolitical changes are already quite obvious and largely irreversible. No matter how the subsequent events unfold, something in the world order has changed once and for all.The outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic has been a decisive moment in the destruction of the unipolar world and the collapse of globalization. The crisis of unipolarity and the slippage of globalization has been noticeable since the very beginning of the 2000s - the 9/11 catastrophe, the sharp growth of China's economy, the return to global politics of Putin's Russia as an increasingly sovereign entity, the sharp activation of the Islamic factor, the growing crisis of migrants and the rise of populism in Europe and even the United States that resulted in the election of Trump and many other parallel phenomena have made it clear that the world formed in the 90s around the dominance of the West, the US and global capitalism has entered a crisis phase. The multipolar world order is beginning to form with new central actors, civilizations, as anticipated by Samuel Huntington. While there were signs of emerging multipolarity, a trend is one thing, and objective reality another. It is like cracked ice in spring. it is clear that it will not last long, but at the same time, it is undeniably here - you can even move across it, albeit with risk. No one can be certain when the cracked ice will actually give way. We can now begin the countdown to a multipolar world order - the starting point is the coronavirus epidemic. The pandemic has buried globalization, open society and the global capitalist system. The virus has forced us onto the ice and individual enclaves of humanity have begun to take their isolated historical trajectories.The coronavirus has buried all the major myths of globalization: the effectiveness of open borders and the interdependence of the world's countries,the ability of supranational institutions to cope with an extraordinary situation,the sustainability of the global financial system and the world economy as a whole when faced with serious challenges, the uselessness of centralized states, socialist regimes and disciplinary methods in solving acute problems and the complete superiority of liberal strategies over them,the total triumph of liberalism as a panacea for all problem situations.Their solutions have not worked in Italy, or other EU countries, nor in the United States. The only thing that has proven effective is the sharp closure of society, reliance on domestic resources, strong state power and isolation of the sick from the healthy, citizens from foreigners, etc.At the same time, even the countries of the West reacted to the pandemic quite differently: the Italians introduced full quarantine, Macron introduced a regime of state dictatorship (in the spirit of Jacobins), Merkel gave €500 billion to support the population, and Boris Johnson, following the spirit of Anglo-Saxon individualism, suggested that the disease be considered a private matter for every Englishman and refused to carry out testing, sympathizing in advance with those who will lose loved ones. Trump established a state of emergency in the United States, closing communications with Europe and the rest of the world. If the West acts so disparately and contradictorily, then what about the rest of the countries? Everyone seems to be saving themselves as they can. This has been best accomplished by China, which, as a result of the Communist Party's hands-on policies, has established tough disciplinary methods to fight the infection and accused the United States of spreading it. The same accusation was made by Iran, which has been hit hard by the virus - including among the country's top leadership.
Thus the virus has ripped apart the open society at the seams and thrust mankind forward on its voyage toward a multipolar world.
Whatever ended with the fight against the coronavirus, it is clear that globalization has collapsed. This could almost certainly spell the end of liberalism and its total ideological dominance. It is hardly possible to foresee the final version of the future world order - especially in its details. Multipolarity is a system that historically has not existed, and if we look for some distant analogue of it, we should turn not to the era of more or less equivalent European states after the Westphalian world, but to the time preceding the era of the Great Geographical Discovery, when, along with Europe (divided into Western and Eastern Christian countries), the Islamic world, India, China and Russia existed as independent civilizations. The same civilizations existed in the pre-colonial period in America (the Incas, Aztecs, etc.) and Africa. There were links and contacts between these civilizations, but there was no single binding type with universal values, institutions and systems.
The post-coronavirus world is likely to involve individual world regions, civilizations, continents gradually forming into independent players. At the same time, the universal model of liberal capitalism will likely collapse. This model currently serves as the common denominator of the whole structure of unipolarity: from the absolutization of the market to parliamentary democracy and human rights ideology, including notions of progress and the law of technological development which have become a dogma in New Age Europe and spread to all human societies through colonization (directly or indirectly in the form of westernization).
Much will depend on who will defeat the epidemic and how: where disciplinary measures prove effective, they will enter the political and economic order of the future as an essential component. The same conclusion can be reached by those who, on the other hand, will not be able to cope with the threat of a pandemic through openness and by avoiding harsh measures. Temporary alienation dictated by the direct threat of contagion from another country and another region, the severance of economic ties and the necessary alienation from a single financial system will force states in the epidemic to look for self-reliance, because the priority will be food security, a minimum autonomy and economic autarchy to meet the vital needs of the population on the other side of any economic dogma, which, before the coronavirus crisis, was considered the only possibility. Even where liberalism and capitalism are preserved, they will be placed in the national framework in the spirit of mercantilist theories insisting on maintaining a monopoly on foreign trade in the hands of the state. Those who are less connected to the liberal tradition may well move in the inventories of the most optimal organization of ""big space"" in other directions - taking into account civilizational and cultural peculiarities.One cannot say in advance what the multipolar model as a whole will eventually become, but the very fact of breaking the generally binding dogma of liberal globalization will open up completely new opportunities and ways for each civilization.After the coronavirus: multipolar safety. The multipolar world will create an entirely new security architecture. It may not be more sustainable or adaptable to conflict resolution, but it will be different. In this new model, the West, the US and NATO, if NATO still exists, will be just one factor alongside others. The US itself will clearly not be able (and probably will not want to, if the Trump line finally prevails in Washington) to play the role of the sole global arbitrator, and therefore, the US will acquire a different status after quarantine and state of emergency. It can be compared to Israel's role in the Middle East. Israel is undoubtedly a powerful country, actively influencing the balance of power in the region, but it does not export its ideology and values to the surrounding Arab countries. On the contrary, it preserves its Jewish identity for itself, trying rather to free itself from the holders of other values than to include them in its composition. Building a wall with Mexico and Trump's call for Americans to focus on their own internal problems is similar to Israel’s path: the United States will be a powerful power, but its liberal-capitalist ideology will only remain for itself, rather than by attracting outsiders. The same will apply to Europe. Consequently, the most important factor of the unipolar world will radically change its status.This, of course, will lead to a redistribution of forces and functions among other civilizations. Europe, if it keeps its unity to any degree, is likely to create its own military bloc independent of the United States, which was already discussed after the collapse of the Soviet Union (the Eurocorps project) and has been repeatedly hinted at by Macron and Merkel. Not being directly hostile to the United States, such a bloc will in many cases follow European interests proper, which may sometimes differ sharply from those of the United States. First and foremost, it will affect relations with Russia, Iran, China and the Islamic world.China will have to transform itself from a beneficiary of globalization and adapt to pursue its national interests as a regional power. This is exactly what all the processes in China have been heading towards lately - strengthening Xi Jianping's power, the ""One belt – One road"" project, etc. It will no longer be about globalization with Chinese characteristics, but an explicit Far Eastern project with special Confucian and partly socialist characteristics. Conflicts in the Pacific Ocean with the United States will clearly at some point become more acute.The Islamic world will face a difficult problem of the new paradigm of self-organization, as in the conditions of formation of large spaces - Europe, China, USA, Russia, etc., individual Islamic countries will not be able to be fully commensurate with the rest and effectively defend their interests. There will be a need for several poles of Islamic integration – Shia (with the center in Iran) and Sunni, where, along with Indonesia and Pakistan in the East, a Western Sunni block around Turkey and some Arab countries of Egypt or the Gulf states is likely to be constructed.And finally, in the multipolar world order, Russia has a historical chance to strengthen itself as an independent civilization which will see an increase in power as a result of the sharp decline of the West and its internal geopolitical fragmentation. Yet, at the same time, it will also be a challenge: before fully asserting itself as one of the most influential and powerful poles in the multipolar world, Russia will have to pass the maturity test, preserving its unity and reasserting its zones of influence in the Eurasian space. It is not yet clear where the southern and western borders of Russia-Eurasia will be post-coronavirus. This will largely depend on what regime, what methods and efforts Russia will use to cope with the pandemic and what political consequences this has. In addition, it is impossible to knowingly predict the state of other ""large spaces"" - the poles of the multipolar world. The constitution of the Russian perimeter will depend on many factors, some of which may prove to be quite acute and conflictual.Gradually, a system of multipolar settlement will be formed - either on the basis of the UN reformed under the conditions of multipolarity, or in the form of some new organization. Again, everything here will depend on how the fight against the coronavirus unfolds.The virus as a mission. One should not be deceived: the world coronavirus pandemic is a turning point in world history. Not only are stock indices and oil prices collapsing, the world order itself is falling. We are living in the period of the end of liberalism and its ""obviousness"" as global meta-narrative, the end of its measures and standards. Human societies will soon become free floating: no more dogmas, no more dollar-imperialism, no more free market spells, no more Fed dictatorship or global stock exchanges, no more subservience to the world media elite. Each pole will build its future on its own civilizational foundations. It is obviously impossible to say what this will look like or what it will lead to. However, it is already clear that the old world order is becoming a thing of the past, and quite distinct contours of a new reality are emerging before us. What neither ideologies, nor wars, nor fierce economic battles, nor terror, nor religious movements have been able to do, has been accomplished by an invisible, yet deadly virus. It brought with it death, pain, horror, panic, sorrow... but also the future.",0
"As of midday on March 16th, the number of total cases of coronavirus around the globe sits at 188,298. Out of them 80,848 have recovered, and 7,499 have died. Italy is still leading globally with the most active cases, currently at 23,073 and a death toll of 2,158.On March 16th, Italy reported 349 new deaths from COVID-19.
Canada closed its borders to all foreign nationals, except US citizens, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged people to stay at home to help stem the spread of the new coronavirus.“We will be denying entry into Canada to people who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents,” Trudeau told reporters at a news conference outside his home, where he is under self-quarantine after his wife tested positive for the virus.He said Americans were exempted from the border ban. Trudeau also said he will restrict international flights to four Canadian airports from March 18th. Domestic flights will not be affected.Russia will ban the entry of foreign nationals and stateless people from March 18th to May 1st in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the government said. The ban will not apply to diplomatic representatives, airplane crew members and some other categories of people, it said.French President Emmanuel Macron has announced strict reductions in movement starting from midday on March 17th, for at least 15 days, saying “we are at war.”In a televised address to the nation, Macron said people should stay at home and only go out for essential activities. He said that anyone flouting the restrictions would be punished.France will deploy 100,000 police to enforce a lockdown, and fixed checkpoints will be set up across the country.“Stay at home,” Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said, adding that fines of up to 135 euros would be handed out to those who do not respect the new restrictions, which are centered on avoiding all but essential social contact.Entry into the European Union’s Schengen zone will also be closed from March 17th, the French president said.US President Donald Trump issued new guidelines to help fight the coronavirus, including a recommendation that people avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people, discretionary travel, and going to bars, restaurants and food courts.At a White House news briefing, Trump said the new guidelines from his coronavirus task force applied for 15 days and were meant to slow the spread of the virus.
In an answer to a question about the US economy, the Republican president said the country “may be” heading towards recession amid the pandemic, which he called an “invisible enemy”.Ireland expects its number of coronavirus cases to increase to around 15,000 by the end of the month from 169 currently, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said, predicting it would be dealing with the pandemic for many months.“We would expect that by the end of the month there would be maybe 15,000 people who would have tested positive for Covid-19, most of those will not need treatment but a proportion will need to be hospitalised and we need to make sure that it doesn’t happen at the same time,” Vardkar told a news conference.China appears to have flattened the curve, and 20 out of 21 registered cases of coronavirus were people who came from abroad. Wuhan will require all overseas returnees to undergo quarantine.Lockdowns in most of the European countries have begun, with Spain expected to have a very sharp rise in infected in the next several days.Meanwhile, in Germany, the contestants in Big Brother entered the house on February 6th and haven’t been told of the international pandemic and the lockdowns.The show’s producers, for the TV channel Sat.1, defended the decision not to update the housemates on the crisis going on in the outside world, telling the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung that the information blackout would only be lifted in certain circumstances, such as a family member’s illness. They also pointed to “special hygiene measures” taken to protect residents themselves from infection, though did not explain what those measures entailed.But after uproar on social media, Sat.1 changed its position – and announced a live special episode, due to air before the regular slot at 7pm on the evening of March 17th, in which the housemates will be told of the growing crisis. They will be given the opportunity to ask questions about the state of the nation, as well as receive video messages from their relatives.Big Brother Brazil’s cast are also completely unaware of coronavirus – since they entered the house on January 21st, producers have refused to update them on the outside world.Big Brother Canada’s contestants are in a similar situation, as they entered the house on March 4th.One clip, from Canada, shows the contestants discussing the sudden absence of a live audience for evictions from the house: when the first member left, just five days in, the crowd was audible from within the house, but by March 14th, when the second was evicted, the silence was noticeable.With every passing day, the entire coronavirus crisis is looking more and more like some freaky TV series that involves most of the countries around the world. While some political leaders call the ongoing developments a “war” against the invisible enemy, the real numbers and developments on the ground clearly demonstrate that the threat is drastically exaggerated and intentionally fueled by media and governments.There are several phenomena caused by attempts of various forces and influence groups to exploit the coronavirus narrative:Financial circles and governments are using the coronavirus crisis in order to achieve own financial and political goals, as well as to cover crissi developments in the global economy (the Saudi offensive on the oil market is another sign of the crisis);The outbreak is exploited by the Washington establishment and its allies to increase pressure on the opponents of the US-dominated global order. China became the first target of the attack. Now, similar developments could be observed in Russia. Large Russian cities and even government bodies (like the foreign ministry) are being targeted by waves of fake news and artificial hysteria. Anti-government, Western-backed forces operating inside Russia will likely work to exploit the coronavirus narrative to destabilize the situation in the country;
The virus outbreak became a useful pretext for a further regionalization of the world that breaks into seprated economic political clusters. The myth about the ‘European unity’ as well as the ‘Euro-Atlantic’ one is destroyed. All states are fighting the crisis almost alone. Only so-called “bad guys” like China, Venezuela or Cuba are offering their help to other states;Governments are strengthening surveillance and security measures limiting freedoms of citizens;Global corporations are exploiting the crisis to shape their business processes and pushing forward the concept of distance working (from home). So, they would be able to reduce costs and say goodbye to their already limited social obligations;Experts and analysts note that the increasing economic and social tensions are increasing chances of open military conflicts. One of the possible hot points is the Middle East, where the US-Iranian conflict is on the rise.There are no doubts that the crisis will end. However, the world will not be same.",0

"Europ is in panic. It’s targeted not only by a new wave of illegal migrants sent by Turkey and the collapse of energy markets, but also by a coronavirus threat. Over the past days, Italy became the key center of the coronavirus outbreak sparking declarations about a total lockdown.The virus, known as Covid-19, has now infected close to 115,000 people worldwide and resulted in more than 4,000 deaths. The majority of these cases are in mainland China, where the outbreak first emerged. As of March 10, a total of 80,761 cases and 3,136 deaths were registered. However, Beijing seems to be gaing an upper hand and the rate of infection has been slowing significantly in the country, and the situation stabilizing. Over 60,000 people recovered and during the past 24 hours, there were only 26 new coronavirus cases registered in mainland China. The nubmer of coronavirus cases per 1 million of population stands at approximately 56.1.South Korea, which was another epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, is also dealing with the situation successfully. The toal number of cases is 7,513. The number of death is 54. During the past 24 hours there were 35 new cases registered only. The total number of cases per 1 million of people is 146.5.The situation is fully different in Europe. During the past few days only, Italy (mostly), France and Spain turned to be the center of chaos and virus hysteria. The speed and scale of the outbreak is surprising. According to live updates, there were a total of 9,172 cases registered in Italy with 463 deaths already. 1,797 new cases and 97 new deaths were registered on March 9 only. The number of total cases per 1 million of population is 151.7. This is higher than in China and South Korea despite the fact that the density of population in Italy is much lower.The crisis in France and Span is not so acute, but it also surprising.Europe has almost 1.5 months to prepare for the spreading coronavirus problem. However, no effective measures were apparently employed. The disregard to epidemiological norms and measures needed to combat the oubreak is among the key issues named by local sources.Until recently, all limitations and measures employed by Italian authorities were merely a formality. On March 9, the northern region of Lombardy and 14 other provinces were placed under lockdown. Additional measures included blanket travel restrictions, a ban on all public events, the closures of schools and public spaces such as movie theaters, and the suspension of religious services including funerals or weddings. However, Italy is already the center of the outbreak and all these measures appear to be at least late.For example, India, which is located relatively near such centers of the outbreak as South Korea, China and Iran, did not fall into such a crisis. The difference is in the measures employed.There is little doubt that the coronavirus threat is overestimated by mainstream media and governemnts. Covid-19 is in fact an ordinary viral disease with a slightly higher mortality from complications for people of old age or peopel with weakened immunity. Another open secret is that the current hysteria over the outbreak is being successfully used by some players to achieve their own economic and geopolitical goals. Looking at the current situation in Europe, one could suppose that some forces have seized an opportunity and are now fueling the coronavirus crisis intentionally.",0

"We believe that the vacuum of the universe is in equilibrium, that is, the whole cycle of possible entropy has passed… but what if it's just pretending to be?
The coronavirus and the collapse of the world order. Over the last few decades we have awaited something fatal, something irreversible and decisive. Perhaps the coronavirus epidemic will be that event.It is too early to draw exact conclusions, but some elements of geopolitics and ideology may have already passed the point of no return.The coronavirus epidemic represents the end of globalization. The open society is ripe for infection. Anyone who wants to tear down borders prepares the territory for the total annihilation of humanity. You can smile, of course, but people in white HazMat suits will put a stop to the inappropriate laughter. Only closedness can save us. Closedness in all senses, closed borders, closed economies, closed supply of goods and products, what Fichte called a ""closed trade state."" Soros should be lynched, and a monument should be built for Fichte. Lesson one.Second: the coronavirus turns the last page of liberalism. Liberalism has made it easier to spread the virus - in all senses. The epidemic requires the demolition of all differences. Liberalism is the virus. A little more time will pass, and liberals will be equated with ""lepers"", infectious ""maniacs"" who call to dance and have fun in the midst of the plague. The Liberal is the carrier of the coronavirus, its apologist. This is especially the case if it turns out that it was created in the United States, the ""citadel of liberalism"", as a biological weapon. Lesson two: liberalism kills.
Third: the criteria for success and prosperity of countries and societies are changing dramatically. In the battle against the epidemic, neither China's wealth nor the European social system, nor the absence of a social system in the United States (which has the world’s greatest military and financial power) will save them. Even the Iranian’s spiritual and vertical regime is not helping. The coronavirus has cut off the entire tip of civilization - oil, finance, free exchange, the market, the total dominance of the Fed... the world's leaders are helpless. Completely different criteria have come to the fore: the possession of an antivirus, the ability to autonomously prove life for themselves and their loved ones in conditions of maximum closure. Meeting these criteria means reassessing all values. The vaccine is in the province of those who most likely developed the virus, and is therefore an unreliable solution. However, closure and the transition to self-sufficiency is something that everyone can do, although doing so requires multipolarity. Small farms and natural exchange will survive the total collapse of everything.So, what would be the next logical steps after a triumphant march of coronavirus across the planet? At best, the appearance of several relatively closed world zones - civilizations, large spaces, or - at worst - the worlds of Mad Max and Resident Evil. The Russian series ""The Epidemic"" is becoming a reality in front of our eyes. The plague gods. I am beginning to understand why in some societies the plague gods were revered and worshipped. The coming of the plague allows for a complete renewal of societies. The epidemic has no logic and spares neither the noble nor the rich, nor the powerful. It destroys everyone indiscriminately, and brings people back to the simple fact of being. The plague gods are the fairest. Antonin Artaud wrote about this, comparing theater to the plague. The purpose of the theater, according to Artaud, is, with all possible cruelty, to return man to the fact that he is, that he is here and now, a fact which he persistently and consistently seeks to forget. The plague is an existential phenomenon. The Greeks called Apollo Smintheus ""the Mouse god"" and attributed to his arrows the power to bring plague. This is where the Iliad begins, as everyone knows.That is what Apollo would do if he looked at modern mankind - bankers, bloggers, rappers, deputies, office workers, migrants, feminists... that's about it.Bunuel has a movie called ""The Exterminating Angel"" which is more or less about this. How the world ends.One can also take note of the elements of the epidemic that seem to suggest its being man-made, either allowing the West to use the virus against its geopolitical opponents (which explains China and Iran, but not Italy and the rest) or even the start of the targeted extermination of all these extra billions by a small circle of humanity with a vaccine which was itself produced by ""progress"" and ""open society."" In this case, the ""plague gods"" may turn out to be quite specific representatives of the global financial elite, which has long recognized the ""limits of growth."" But even in this case - especially if this is not the beginning of a full-fledged global genocide, but only a test of the pen - the conclusion is the same: those who pretend to be responsible for human societies are not what they seem.Liberalism is only a pretext for mass extermination, as colonization and the spread of the standards of modern Western civilization were. The global elites and their local puppets may be counting on surviving with a vaccine, but something suggests that this may be where the catch lies. The virus may behave inadequately, and the processes that have begun on the civilizational level, and even in individual unpredictable spontaneous events, may disrupt their carefully thought out plans.The entire world economy may not collapse within a few months, but it seems to be headed in exactly that direction.Everything that modern people consider ""sustainable"" and ""reliable"" is pure illusion, the coronavirus is showing that clearly and vividly. In fact, once the logic of what is happening continues to develop a little further, we might see how the world ends - at least the world we know and knew. And, at the same time, the first contours of something else will begin to appear.Matter at risk. It is curious that parallel to the coronavirus, which has become, in a sense, the subject of civilization, discussions in the scientific community about “bubbles of nothing” broke out, reviving some hypotheses of the famous physicist Edward Witten, one of the main theorists of the phenomena of “superstrings.”According to the ideas of modern physicists, ""bubbles of nothing"" can arise from a ""0 vacuum"", i.e. a vacuum which has not reached stability, but only seems to have reached it. In the ten-dimensional world (with 4 ordinary measurements and 6 more, present through compacification) such ""bubbles of nothing"" are quite probable. If they arise, they may suck galaxies into nothing and swallow the Universe. These whirlpools spawned of unstable vacuums leave quite an impression.And again, as in the case of coronavirus, they say “nothing bad is happening, everything is under control.” Representatives of the scientific elite reassure us that the chance of the appearance of the “bubbles of nothing” is ridiculously small.But it seems to me that it is not. On the contrary, it is quite significant. The modern world is exactly such a ""bubble of nothing"" which is growing rapidly, absorbing meaning and dissolving existence: liberalism and globalization are its most vivid expressions. The coronavirus is also a bubble of nothing.The nature of this virus itself is interesting (although I hate the concept of ""nature"", there is nothing more senseless). It is something between a living being - it has DNA or RNA - and a mineral (it has no cells). However, most of all, it reminds us of a neural network or even an Artificial Intelligence. It is either there, or not, living, or inanimate ... that is precisely what the “nonequilibrium vacuum” is, which creates these “bubbles of nothing.”We believe that the vacuum of the universe is in equilibrium, that is, the whole cycle of possible entropy has passed… but what if this only seems to be the case?When you hear the story about the Wuhan market and imagine the struggle of bats with poisonous snakes, their fierce exchange of contagion and killer microscopic arrows of non-existence shaped like a crown, it is impossible to get rid of the image of bubbles of nothing. The same feeling is brought about by the drop in oil prices and the collapse of stock indices. Even war - with its specificity and existential awakening - does not save us from the attack of nothing, as the motivation of modern wars is so deeply entangled in material, financial and corrupt interests, having lost its original purity: the direct encounter with death. It only serves as another bubble of nothing, fulfilling its instructions to lead matter to total oblivion.Plague as Event. Is it possible to expect that having coped with the coronavirus, mankind will draw the appropriate conclusions, curtail globalization, throw out liberal superstitions, halt migration and put an end to the obscene technical inventions which are immersing everyone deeper and deeper into endless labyrinths of matter? The answer is quite clearly no. Everyone will quickly go back to their old ways in the blink of an eye, before the corpses are even buried. As soon as - and if - the markets come to life and the Dow Jones wakes back up, everything will be back to normal. The naive one is he who thinks otherwise. But what does that mean? It means that even an epidemic of this scale will be turned into an unfortunate misunderstanding. No one will understand the meaning of the coming of the plague gods, no one will think about ""bubbles of nothing"" and everything will repeat over and over again until it reaches the point of no return. If one pays close attention to the passage of time, it should be clear that we are currently crossing that point.",0

" from abroad, but it wants good relations with other nations."" This was the response of the Chinese Emperor Qianlong in the eighteenth century, in response to the request of the then British King George III, to conclude agreements that facilitate the export of British goods to the Chinese market.The Chinese market was a solution to the emerging crisis of the British bourgeoisie during the Industrial Revolution. When the voices of revolutions escalated in Britain later in 1895: “Bread, bread, bread,” the answer of the British ruling class was ready: either imperialism or civil war, either you allow us to We occupy nations other than you, or we fight a civil war with you that ends in your hunger and death. This is what happened and is happening to this day!A return to the Chinese Emperor who refused to facilitate import, as Britain imported tea and silk from China, and paid silver instead, which strengthened the Chinese (silver reserve) and boosted China's trade balance.There were two wars Britain fought to break this formula, which led to two trade agreements through which the ports of China were opened against British merchandise by force, the ""Van Jing"" agreement, and the ""Tianjin"" agreement or ""Tiansin"".Many narratives argue that the export of opium by force to China was one of the goods that crossed during the two agreements, but there is a peculiarity to the export of opium in the agendas of British policy at the time, namely the disruption of the Chinese production wheel. The British problem was based not only on the fort surrounding the Chinese market, but also on the empire's export capabilities.The new empire suffers from a similar crisis. According to official statistics issued by the International Trade Organization, the volume of trade exchange between the United States of America and China reached 737 billion, of which 557 billion was imported to the US market from China, not outside it. Today, China has $ 1.2 trillion in debt owed by the United States of America (new silver stock).Perhaps the new American empire does not have the direct options of the British Empire to reduce the size of Chinese exports to the world and its control over the markets, but it - and from its position as a brutal global power - is able to work hard to disrupt the production wheel, albeit temporarily, at the opponent.Corona, Uyghur, and Huawei are the triangle of the United States to work in two directions: disrupting production at home or disrupting consumption at the other end (markets).Some people may think that the corona-to-virus ratio is an exaggeration in conspiracy theory, and we believed in our first observations of ancient science fiction films, including ""resident Evil"", that this could not become reality one day!The statements issued by the Health Organization regarding Corona, as a pandemic or an international emergency, have not been contradicted and there is no need to prevent travel to the countries of origin with it. In any case, the limits of infection with the virus did not reach what qualifies it to describe the epidemic, such as the case of the Spanish influenza virus in 1918, which claimed a third of the earth’s population, but the Western media machine used its full capabilities to make the virus - regardless of its origin - a good opium to disrupt exports. Chinese.It is not enough to intimidate the markets of goods infected with the virus, but it is also accompanied by a ""moral"" discourse that talks about suppressing Muslims in China, and this speech targets a wide group of consumers in the eastern markets.The American used to reflect all political discourse and discourse into a ""dollar"". In American foreign policy, this ""pro-Uighur"" speech (regardless of the reality of the Uighurs reality in China) equals $ 15 billion in exchanges with Pakistan, $ 45 billion with Indonesia, and $ 244 billion with Arab countries.In this context, it was not strange for Google to activate the Android war with Huawei, in the context of disrupting it for some time from the most urgent task, which is 5G Networks, and its involvement in the task of developing an alternative operating system as soon as possible. It protects the giant from a surprising loss in the mobile phone market.The crisis of the United States of America is not much different from Britain’s crisis in the opium wars, but the tools of direct wars are no longer available today, and there is a need for a lot of opium in the near future, starting from bacterial wars, and not ending with technological and media wars.",0
"Coronavirus, Uyghur, and Huawei are a triangle of tools for the United States that work in two directions: disrupting production at home, in China, and disrupting consumption at the other end (markets).

"On 29 January WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that there was no reason to declare the outbreak of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV in China a pandemic risk. On 30 January, he declared the virus an international emergency, but made clear that there was no reason for countries to issue travel-advisories against travelling to China. Let me speculate – the ‘international emergency’ was declared at the request of Washington, and the comment against the travel-advisory was an addition by Dr. Tedros himself, as he realized that there was indeed no reason for panic, that China is doing wonders in stemming the virus from spreading and in detecting the virus early on.In fact, Dr. Tedros has himself, as well as other high-ranking WHO officials, on various occasions praised China for her effort to contain the virus, the speed with which Wuhan (population of 11 million, capital of the center-eastern Province of Hubei) and China as a whole has reacted to the outbreak. The latest achievement – in 8 days China has built in Wuhan a 25,000 m2 special hospital for treatment of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV and possible mutations, with 1,000 beds, and for about 1,400 medical personnel, for a budget of the equivalent of US$ 43 million – equipped with state-of-the-art medical technology. No other country in the world would have been capable of such an achievement.Nevertheless, and against WHO’s guidance, Washington immediately advised its citizens not to travel to China, and withdrew non-essential staff from US consulates and the Embassy in Beijing, thereby triggering an avalanche of similar reactions among Washington vassals around the globe – i.e. most of the European countries did likewise, many of them canceled their flights to China, as did of course the US. For some reasons I have yet to understand, Russia closed her 4,200 km long border with China. Would Russia fall to the western panic-mongering propaganda hype? – Hard to believe. But then what is the reason?The NYT and WashPo are on a vicious daily campaign to slander and vilify China with lies and manipulated information on how badly China is managing the disease, when the complete opposite is the case. Compare this to the common flu epidemic, that hits the US and most of the western countries, despite the fact that the US and Europe have virtually implemented carpet vaccination (in some US States and EU countries even compulsory).Yet, this 2019 / 2020 flu season which is far from over, has so far claimed more than 8,400 lives alone in the US, more than 140,000 hospitalizations and more than 8 million infected people. The US has about 330 million people. Compare this to China’s 1.4 billion population – with, as of 3 February, an infection rate of less than 21,000, a death toll of 425 in China, and outside of China reported two, one in Hong Kong, another one in the Philippines.Expand these statistics to Europe and you find similar figures. Of course, nobody talks about it. This is an annual occurrence – a bonanza for the western pharma industry. In the west, disease is business. The more the merrier. Once you are in the “medical mill”, it’s difficult to escape. “Specialists’ find always another reason to send you yet to another “specialist” – for another treatment. The ignorant patient has no option than to obey – after all its his health and life. In China it is the total opposite. The Chinese system does everything for its population’s health and well-being.Yet, China bashing in one way or another seems to intensify by the day. Yesterday, 3 February, the UN in Geneva has issued an edict that all UN employees returning from China must stay home and work from home for 14 days, i.e. a dictated self-quarantine. And new contracts for Chinese staff will be temporarily suspended. This is all propaganda against China.Quarantine is absolutely not necessary. Chinese biologists of the Office of Science and Technology of the city of Wuxi (south-eastern Jiangsu province, near Shanghai) have developed a test kit that can detect the 2019-nCoV virus within 8 – 15 minutes, similar to a pregnancy test. This test kit is available to the world. In fact, it has been used to test an airline crew member arriving from New York at the Zurich airport and feeling ill. Within less than an hour, the crew member was sent home – it was the common flu.In China, where by now scientific evidence is mounting that the disease – like all the coronaviral diseases, including the 2019-nCoV predecessor SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 2002 / 2003 also in China), and its Middle East equivalent, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are not only laboratory fabricated, but also patented. And so are many others, for example, Ebola and HIV. Both, SARS and 2019-nCoV are not only man-made, but they are also focusing on the Chinese race. That’s why you find very few people infected in the 18 countries where the coronavirus has spread.It sounds like a strange coincidence that in October 2019 a simulation with precisely the coronavirus was carried out at the John Hopkins Institute in the US, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the WEF (World Economic Forum), as well as the Pirbright Institute of the UK, one of the world’s few level 4 (highest security level) bio-warfare laboratories.The west’s ‘demolition’ priority seems to have shifted drastically from Russia to China. Why? – Because China is an ever-stronger economic power, soon to surpass the United States in absolute terms. Since mid-2017, China is already number one, measured by the PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) indicator, indeed the most important one, because it demonstrates what people can actually buy with the money.China’s currency, the Yuan, is also advancing rapidly as a reserve currency, gradually replacing the US-dollar. When that happens, that real money, like the Chinese Yuan, based on a hard economy and covered by gold, against a “fake” fiat currency (based on nothing), like the US-dollar, is taking the lead, then the US-dollar hegemony is broken and the US economy doomed.To prevent that from happening Washington is doing everything possible to destabilize China – see Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Uyghurs in China’s western Xinjiang Province, Tibet, the infamous Trump-inspired “tariff war” – and now the new coronavirus outbreak. The death toll is at present about 2.1% (of total cases of infection), down from 2.3% a week ago.But that and the constant bashing with negative western propaganda, travel bans, border closures, flight bans – and more – plus the disease itself, the medical care, work absenteeism, medication and medical equipment, not to forget the specially-built 1,000-bed emergency hospital in Wuhan – and an 8% average decline at the Shanghai stock exchange, bear a considerable economic cost for China. So much so, that the People’s Bank of China (PBC) has recently injected some 1.2 billion yuan (about US$ 174 million equivalent) into the economy.This new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, may just be a trial. Imagine a stronger mutation of a coronavirus would be implanted into the Chinese population, say with a mortality rate of 10% to 20% or higher – it could cause real havoc. However, a stronger version may not be so easily controllable and directable – i.e. towards the Chinese race – and may risk spreading to the Caucasian race as well – meaning the executioner would risk committing mass suicide.Remember the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the deadliest in history, infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide – at that time about one-third of the planet’s population – and killed at least 50 million people (a death rate of 10%), including some 700,000 Americans.While preparing for the worst, because Washington – with the help of its level 4 bio-war lab –  will not let go easily, China’s approach of endless inventive creation, avoiding conflicts, will outlive the aggressor.",0

"As of January 28, up to 20 Chinese cities have been locked down or targeted by partial movement restrictions, with public transport in and out of them closed over the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A total of 106 people died of the disease. 976 patients remained in critical conditions. 6,973 people were suspected of being infected, while 4,515 cases were confirmed.Troops clad in hazmat suits, with automatic rifles were deployed, and namely in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province. The city that houses approximately 11 million people is the center of the crisis. In total, approximately, 60 million people are under travel restrictions.Additionally, 8 confirmed cases were reported in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 7 in Macao Special Administrative Region and 5 in Taiwan.Chinese authorities are urgently building a 1,000-bed emergency field hospital, specifically to cure those infected by the coronavirus.  The hospital is modeled after the Xiaotangshan SARS hospital in Beijing. The facility will be a prefabricated structure on a 270,000-square-foot lot, slated for completion on February 3.The SARS hospital was built from scratch in 2003 in just six days during an outbreak of a similar respiratory virus that had spread from China to more than a dozen countries and killed about 800 people. The SATRS hospital featured individual isolation units that looked like rows of tiny cabins.On January 26, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that China started to develop vaccine for the novel coronavirus after successfully isolating the first strain of the virus.All people entering and leaving China are having their temperature measured.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most people get infected with coronaviruses at one point in their lives, but symptoms are typically mild to moderate. In some cases, the viruses can cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis.
These are more common in animals, and only a handful are known to affect humans, as is the case now. This is what happened with the coronaviruses known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, between 2012-17) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov, 2002-3), both of which are known to cause more severe symptoms.The 2019-nCoV virus has spread, at a relatively rapid pace. The first case was reported on December 31st, 2019, in Wuhan, China. The first cured individual, named Chen, a 56-year old woman was reported by Chinese authorities, as per Chinese media. She spent 2 weeks in hospital and was fully cured. Since then, the virus has appeared in several other countries, including Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. The first U.S. case was confirmed on January 21st in a man in Washington state who had recently traveled to Wuhan. On January 24th, officials confirmed a second case in a woman from Chicago who had also recently traveled to the Chinese city. On January 24th, the first three cases were confirmed in France, with two patients being hospitalised in Paris and the other in the southwestern city of Bordeaux. Australia also confirmed its first case of the virus. On January 28th, three suspected cases of the coronavirus were reported in the Indian capital.The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus an “emergency in China,” but not an international concern.
According to the Imperial College London‌, self-sustaining human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the only plausible explanation of the scale of the outbreak in Wuhan. The released report estimates that on average, each case infected 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) other people up to 18th January 2020. For comparison, during the SARS outbreak each case infected from 2.0 to 3.5 other people.“This implies that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. It is likely, based on the experience of SARS and MERS-CoV, that the number of secondary cases caused by a case of 2019-nCoV is highly variable – with many cases causing no secondary infections, and a few causing many. Whether transmission is continuing at the same rate currently depends on the effectiveness of current control measures implemented in China and the extent to which the populations of affected areas have adopted risk-reducing behaviours,” the report reads.So far, the 2019-nCoV mortality rate has been approximately 2.35%. Therefore, the 2019-nCoV speed of spreading, as well as the fatality percentage is in reality lower than SARS, which took place in 2002-3, also in China. In total, there were 8098 confirmed cases of SARS, with a mortality rate of 9.6%. The virus was contacted from bats. The MERS, which spread in the Middle East, between 2012-17, had a confirmed number of 2,000 infected, and a mortality rate of 36%. It was contacted from camels.The Chinese government is taking extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of the 2019-nCoV. Military men in biological protection suits, blocked cities, and hospital construction efforts allow mainstream media outlets to paint an apocalyptic picture of the developments, claiming a pseudo-apocalyptic endemic that would threaten hundreds of thousands, if not millions. Countries such as the UK, the US, and others are carrying out coronavirus tests of various individuals. Mostly of Chinese origin, or those that have recently been to China.One of the speculations is that the 2019-nCoV outbreak is a result of the leak from a secret (not very) laboratory. One of the Chinese BSL-4 rated labs (highest level of biological safety) is located in Wuhan.A laboratory in Wuhan is on the cusp of being cleared to work with the world’s most dangerous pathogens. The move is part of a plan to build between five and seven biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) labs across the Chinese mainland by 2025, and has generated much excitement, as well as some concerns.Some scientists outside China worry about pathogens escaping, and the addition of a biological dimension to geopolitical tensions between China and other nations. But Chinese microbiologists are celebrating their entrance to the elite cadre empowered to wrestle with the world’s greatest biological threats,” The Nature article from February 2017 starts.Regardless facts, speculations of the biolab in Wuhan became pretty popular, claiming that this is, in fact, a real-life Resident Evil scenario, and its infamous Umbrella Corporation, minus people turning into mindless zombies roaming the streets.Another popular culture comparison is that with the popular game Plague Inc., and that as soon as Greenland hears a Chinese man has sneezed at an airport and it’s closed its borders, and that every other country should follow suit.The media hysteria has gone so far that the developer of Plague Inc., Ndemic Creations, issued a statement saying that their game is realistic, but not with the aim to sensationalize serious world issues. It warned that this is, in fact a game, and not a scientific model.Rather dark memes are on the rise, with there even being a specific subreddit focused on coronavirus jokes. Most are harmless jokes, but many of them are tasteless, but they also serve the purpose of presenting China in a light that it is losing grip of the situation.The apocalyptic coverage of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China demonstrates how mainstream media outlets and social media platforms shape the audience’s perception of reality. While the Chinese government appears to be employing needed measures to contain the outbreak and prevent the virus spread, the MSM uses this measures to feed the audience with speculations that this is a signal of the Chinese inability to keep the situation under control.",0

"There is a pandemic going on, with billions of people locked in their homes and all business grinding to a halt across the globe, over apocalyptic predictions of hospitals brimming with corpses due to this coronavirus.Should any kind of treatment – especially a drug that has been used safely for decades to treat something else, with side effects meticulously documented – be so cavalierly rejected, under the circumstances? Do “experts” really think the world has the luxury of waiting for months or even years for their controlled lab studies?
To ask these questions is to answer them, yet no one seems to bother. Nor is this sort of selective blindness endemic to France; across the Atlantic, the mainstream media raised their voices in unison against chloroquine after US President Donald Trump brought it up as a possible treatment – apparently referring to Dr. Raoult’s work.Dr. Raoult seems to believe [that hydroxychloroquine works on Covid-19], and he’s not alone. In the absence of better solutions – and locking billions of people in their homes indefinitely is not one – don’t we owe humanity to at least try? What do we have to lose?",0

 THEIR PRODUCTION IS PART OF THE AGENDA FOR A NEW WORLD ORDER,0
"For China, it has been exposed to the Coronavirus virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan since the fall of 2019, specifically after the Military Olympics in that city. Chinese leaders consider that the epidemic was introduced to China by the American military delegation participating in these games. This entry might be a coincidence after the virus was engineered in a US military laboratory without taking the necessary precautions if the Chinese leadership wanted not to assume bad faith on the part of the Americans.What strengthens the Chinese allegation is the recognition by Robert Radfield, the director of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), that a number of infections were discovered in the United States before they spread to China. But there is another account that says that the virus was French-made (made in 2003) and was transferred to a Sino-French joint laboratory that opened in 2017 in the city of Wuhan. Bats were experimented with, but one of the bats escaped from the laboratory and the epidemic occurred. However, regardless of the accounts and their accuracy, it has become clear that the greatest possibility is that the virus is man-made and not natural, and therefore open questions about bacterial experiments in laboratories and their feasibility and the possibility of turning them into a weapon of mass destruction.",0
"The world coronavirus pandemic is a turning point in world history. Not only are stock indices and oil prices collapsing, the world order itself is falling. We are living in the period of the end of liberalism and its “obviousness” as global meta-narrative, the end of its measures and standards. Human societies will soon become free floating: no more dogmas, no more dollar-imperialism, no more free market spells, no more Fed dictatorship or global stock exchanges, no more subservience to the world media elite. Each pole will build its future on its own civilizational foundations. It is obviously impossible to say what this will look like or what it will lead to. However, it is already clear that the old world order is becoming a thing of the past, and quite distinct contours of a new reality are emerging before us.
What neither ideologies, nor wars, nor fierce economic battles, nor terror, nor religious movements have been able to do, has been accomplished by an invisible, yet deadly virus. It brought with it death, pain, horror, panic, sorrow… but also the future.",0

"Dr. Didier Raoult, the famous French infectious disease specialist, creator and director of the Mediterranean University-Clinical Institute of Infectious Diseases, used chloroquine for treatment.The results of Dr. Raoult and his institute were outstanding: by the end of March, only 10 of the 2,400 people who received treatment at his institute had died.For 80 years, chloroquine has been a cheap, common, safe generic. And only when it turned out that the medicine was priced at 4 cents, it was established that it couldn’t cure COVID-19 because it would potentially be too cheap and accessible.Another promising drug was remdesivir, an Ebola drug developed by Gilead Sciences. And what? On April 23rd, WHO “accidentally” posted on its website test results that showed that remdesivir was no good.",0

"Fear is being spread around us by the establishment through the mass media (MSM). Common sense is gone and mass hysteria is the new normal. A virus, COVID-19, is used to control the lives of people, and it's also a tool of suppression against the population.I am not going to claim whether there is a virus or not, whether it’s as dangerous as they say, or where it originated, be it in a laboratory or bio-weapon or a real virus. I only see that it has brought fear and, already in some EU countries, terror among the population.Easter 2020; where EU governments forbid us to see our beloved ones, where EU governments forbid us to travel, where most of us lose their income because they forbid us to work and take our bread without compensation. Where they tell us to wait until there is a vaccination from Bill Gates and his sponsors, the criminal gang of the Rockefellers (sponsors of the John Hopkins University). They are controlling our lives, our children's lives. If there is a virus, we can protect the elderly and sick but not destroy whole nations and people. I laughed about conspiracy thinkers in the past, but a lot of it is now reality and “new normal” as they call it. It’s 1984, and we didn’t do a thing to stop it, maybe it was too overwhelming.EU Statement.The EU is mistreating, according to the law, the elderly and sick. You can't forbid people from seeing their old mothers and fathers, or even holding a funeral for them, that is really criminal. Ursula Von der Leyen, head of the EU, also expects that: ""elderly people in care homes cannot be visited as long as there is no vaccine. I know that's difficult, but it's about human lives”, she said. “We have to be disciplined and be very patient"". ""We will have to live with the virus for months, probably until next year."" So many elderly and sick will die without saying goodbye to their beloved ones for almost a year? How cruel. Also, she dictates that we are not allowed to book a trip or holiday, meaning we have to wait for vaccinations and forcibly be vaccinated, also a violation of human rights and freedom. This is especially so when scientists say that younger people are not dying, and weren’t we told ten or twenty years ago that the best way to catch a cold so that we get a better immune system? All of that is thrown out, and according to the EU (German- and French-dominated), our lives will never be the same after COVID-19, how frightening! China is partly back to normal, so why drive people to suicide or hunt them like criminals? Because it’s not about the virus anymore, but about power.
The New Normal.Ready for the one and a half meter society? ""We will have to look for the new normal in the one and a half meter society,"" Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, the head of the EU, and Bundespresident Steinmeier of Germany declared, independent from each other, but on the same time on their national TV stations. “We are still in the middle of the corona crisis, although the number of new deaths and registered infections is leveling off”. “We can get a normal summer out of our minds, because measures will remain in force even after April 28"", they declared as well, meaning lockdown until at least September, or if and when there is a vaccination. Is this democracy? These are the signs of a totalitarian EU body which wants to control the lives of people from birth to death, where they control even our deaths, without proper funerals and loved ones. These are statements not to be made by so-called “democratic” countries, their rhetoric is an Orwellian message to us, the “free” citizens of Europe.Eurobonds.A solidarity fund to ensure that the poorest countries in the EU, like Italy, Spain and Greece -- the countries who, by the way, have been hit the hardest by the COVID-19 crisis and have their countries full of migrants and migrant workers toiling for the rich German supermarkets --pay low interest on their bonds has been taken off the table. Ironically, the richest countries, the Netherlands and Germany, voted against it, while France is silent on this matter. How dare they speak about solidarity, it’s people who are dying, not the Italian government, the people in the streets of Naples, Sicily, and small towns in southern Italy are not dying from COVID-19 but from hunger and suicide. They ask us, the citizens of the EU, to show solidarity, but we can’t because the EU is not for us since it only show ssolidarity with money for themselves and not for us. We are heading towards the suppression and loss of our freedom, a virus was needed and we gave up all our human rights, but this whole process started already in 2015 during the illegal wars in the Middle East.",0
"With more than 4·2 million people infected and over 288 000 deaths as of May 12, 2020, COVID-19 is threatening the entire world, with dramatic consequences for global health and the economy. After the initial outbreaks in China and Italy, the virus rapidly spread worldwide and today the USA is one of the most affected country, with more than 1·3 million cases.In the absence of effective containment measures, COVID-19 outbreaks are characterised by an overwhelming number of patients requiring hospital admission, which could exceed the capacity even of well organised health-care systems.Current knowledge of the clinical course of severe forms of COVID-19 is mainly based on retrospective analyses of Chinese, Italian, and US case series.These studies show that critically ill patients with COVID-19 are mainly older, mostly men, and have at least one comorbidity (primarily hypertension), and mortality is very high (ranging from 56% to 97%) when invasive mechanical ventilation is required. However, limited data are available on factors independently associated with mortality. In The Lancet, Matthew Cummings and colleagues add to our knowledge by reporting the results of a prospective cohort study describing clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of 257 critically ill patients (87 [34%] women and 170 [66%] men, median age 62 years) admitted to high-dependency and intensive care units in two hospitals in New York City over a period of 4 weeks. Notably, critically ill patients with COVID-19 represented 22% of all patients admitted. Compared with other reports, in the cohort described by Cummings and colleagues the proportion of patients younger than 50 years of age was relatively high (55 [21%] of 257 patients). This could be explained by the high incidence of obesity, which affected 39 (71%) of those 55 younger patients. Other common comorbidities were hypertension (162 [63%]), diabetes (92 [36%]), chronic cardiovascular disease (49 [19%]), chronic kidney disease (37 [14%]), and chronic pulmonary disease (24 [9%]). 203 (79%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, median respiratory system compliance was low (26 mL/cm water), and all patients required a high fraction of inspired oxygen despite having relatively high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (median 15 cm water). Although obesity might have affected the mechanical properties of the respiratory system, these findings underline that the optimal management of mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure remains poorly understood.The study by Cummings and colleagues10 confirms that COVID-19 is characterised by a high incidence of multiple organ dysfunction, as shown by the proportion of patients requiring vasopressors (170 [66%]) and renal replacement therapy (79 [31%]). Regarding pharmacological treatments, antibacterial agents were administered empirically to nearly all critically ill patients (229 [89%]) and hydroxychloroquine was administered to 185 (72%), while corticosteroids and interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonists were administered to fewer patients (68 [26%] received corticosteroids and 44 [17%] received IL-6 receptor antagonists). No data are available on the temporal changes of inflammatory markers in patients receiving immunomodulating treatments. Furthermore, no information is provided about strategies of anticoagulant therapies, which are particularly interesting given the high incidence of thromboembolic complications associated with COVID-19.With regards to patient outcome, the study conveys important messages. In particular, it shows that the disease is characterised by a high mortality (101 [39%] after a minimum follow-up of 28 days) and prolonged clinical course, as shown by the high percentage of patients still in the hospital (94 [37%]) at the end of follow-up. The multivariable Cox model analysis showed that history of chronic pulmonary disease had the highest adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for mortality (aHR 2·94 [95% CI 1·48–5·84]). Other independent predictors of death were history of chronic cardiovascular disease (aHR 1·76 [95% CI 1·08–2·86]), older age (aHR 1·31 [95% CI 1·09–1·57]), higher concentrations of IL-6 (aHR 1·11 [95% CI 1·02–1·20] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer per decile increase on admission. There appear to be no differences by sex. The association of mortality with higher concentrations of IL-6 and D-dimer is particularly relevant for two reasons. First, it confirms the key pathogenic role played by the activation of systemic inflammation and endothelial-vascular damage in the development of organ dysfunction. Second, it provides the rationale for the design of clinical trials for measuring the efficacy of treatment with immunomodulating and anticoagulant drugs.The study by Cummings and colleagues shows that clinicians can produce high-quality research even when facing an overwhelming clinical workload. However, despite providing important insights, this work leaves us with some unanswered questions. While waiting for the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine, further studies are required to improve and personalise patient treatment, with particular attention to the role of initial non-invasive respiratory support strategies, timing of intubation, optimal setting of mechanical ventilation, and efficacy and safety of immunomodulating agents and anticoagulation strategies.",1
"Clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rare or absent in children and adolescents; hence, early clinical detection is fundamental to prevent further spreading. We report three young patients presenting with chilblain-like lesions who were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Two of them were asymptomatic and potentially contagious. Skin lesions, such as erythematous rashes, urticaria, and chicken pox-like vesicles, were reported in 18 (20·4%) of 88 patients with COVID-19 in a previous study.3 These symptoms developed at the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection or during hospital stay and did not correlate with disease severity.3 In our cases, lesions involved the acral sites, especially the dorsum of the digits of the feet, beginning as erythematous-violaceous patches that slowly evolved to purpuric lesions and then to blisters and ulceronecrotic lesions, with final complete return to normal. Burning and itching were also present with some of the lesions. Informed consent was obtained from the parents of patients 1 and 2 and from patient 3 himself.Patient 1 was a 14-year-old boy who presented to the hospital with erythematous-violaceous lesions involving the dorsum of all digits of both feet. After 7 days, a few red macules and papules appeared on the lateral and plantar aspect of both feet and a small ulcer developed on the fifth digit of the left foot (figure). Because a family member had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the patient underwent nasopharyngeal swab and was found positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. The lesions disappeared in the following 7 days.Patient 2 was a 14-year-old boy with no known contact with COVID-19 cases who had been asymptomatic since the beginning of the skin disease, for which his parents requested a teledermatology consultation. Manifestations consisted of small erythematous-violaceous lesions on the dorsum of almost all digits of the feet, some of which were characterised by necrotic aspects with blackish crusts (appendix). The lesions lasted 20 days, with complete healing. Nasopharyngeal swab taken by the family's paediatrician 2 days after the skin manifestations appeared was positive for SARS-CoV-2.Patient 3 was an 18-year-old boy whose grandfather had COVID-19 pneumonia. After 2 days with fever (38·5°C), the boy reported the appearance of chilblain-like lesions involving the distal part of all digits of the feet (appendix). Skin manifestations remained unchanged for 10 days, suddenly disappearing without treatment. Nasopharyngeal swab taken 4 days after the skin manifestations appeared was positive. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic.
Acute acro-ischaemic manifestations along the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection seem to be different from classic acrocyanosis, erythema pernio, and vasculitis; however, they could represent a cutaneous expression of the typical thrombotic pattern of COVID-19 due to hyperinflammation4 and altered coagulation and endothelial damage.During this time, children and adolescents with chilblain-like lesions who are otherwise asymptomatic should undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing, which could help early detection of silent carriers.",1
"Despite the daily updates on number of cases, hospital admissions, and deaths around the world and the increasing number of hospital-based case series, some of the fundamental information about how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-2) spreads in the population and who is really at risk of both infection and severe consequences is still missing. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Simon de Lusignan and colleagues1 report on the characteristics of the first 3802 people tested for SARS-CoV-2 within the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) sentinel primary care surveillance network. Unlike most previous studies that examined risk factors for poor prognosis, de Lusignan and colleagues1 report characteristics associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The RCGP surveillance system, set up in 1957, monitors consultations for communicable diseases using a network of 500 general practitioner practices across England, which are broadly representative of the population. Twice-weekly automatic data downloads provide a real-time warning of impending epidemics. In January, 2020, the network expanded to include the testing for SARS-CoV-2 among individuals presenting with symptoms of influenza or respiratory infection. COVID-19 surveillance data, supplemented with data from contact tracing or routine National Health Service facilities, were linked with electronic health records. Of 3802 tests, 587 (15·4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Prevalence of infection was less than 5% in patients younger than 18 years (23 patients were positive [4·6%] of 499 tested) but almost four times as high in people aged 40 years or older (480 [18·2%] of 2637). After adjustment for other factors, infection risk was higher among men than women (odds ratio [OR] 1·55 [95% CI 1·27–1·89]), in black people than white people (OR 4·75 [2·65–8·51]), and in people with obesity than normal-weight people (1·41 [1·04–1·91]). Infection risk was also higher in those living in more deprived or in urban versus rural locations. Surprisingly, household size did not significantly affect infection risk. Among chronic comorbidities examined, only those with chronic kidney disease had an increased risk of infection, whereas the risk in active smokers was around half that observed in never smokers.Two preprint papers have examined population-level risks. One used UK Biobank data and corroborated the results on age, sex, black race, and obesity as risk factors for severe infection; the other, a study of 17 million patients from UK primary care, showed increased risks of in-hospital COVID-19 mortality with older age, male sex, obesity, greater deprivation, and being part of an ethnic minority. Comorbidities and smoking seemed to play a more important role in poor prognosis in those studies than in developing infection in de Lusignan and colleagues' study.Because there are still few population-level studies, the Article by de Lusignan and colleagues is an important new contribution with high-quality statistical methods that allow quantification of independent risks. However, the data are not fully representative of the general population, excluding those with mild or no symptoms and instead reflecting consultation patterns, with over-representation of women and older people but fewer smokers. Lower thresholds for presentation (eg, among women) could dilute test positivity compared with groups who might present only if they are more severely ill. It is also possible that there are unmeasured confounders—eg, social and workplace exposures, interactions, and behaviours, which might explain increased risk in some groups.
Unlike other reports, this study suggests that sex differences in poor outcomes from COVID-19 are at least in part related to differential infection susceptibility. The role of ethnicity in greater susceptibility and poorer prognosis is a growing concern and deserving of further study. It seems that most comorbidities (except chronic kidney disease), although important for predicting prognosis, do not have a major part in susceptibility to infection. Regarding the results on smoking, it is likely that they could reflect consulting patterns and higher rates of non-infectious cough among smokers than non-smokers. Smoking seems important as a risk factor for poor prognosis,4 but studies are conflicting, and the association merits further investigation. The one major modifiable risk factor is obesity, which presents a double problem of increasing susceptibility to infection, as well as the risk of severe consequences.However, what is fundamentally clear is that whatever the specific risk factors, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates existing socioeconomic inequalities, and this needs both exploration and mitigation in the coming months and years.As the UK prepares to loosen lockdown measures, knowing who is most at risk of infection is vital. This study highlights the more susceptible subgroups among those with relevant symptoms, although we cannot be sure why they are more susceptible. Population-level studies with testing among random samples of the general population (irrespective of symptoms), as well as accurate antibody tests of past infection, are urgently needed.",1
"On April 14, 2020, a Chinese official announced at a press conference that indications of three patent herbal drugs were approved to be expanded to include COVID-19 symptoms. This included Lianhuaqingwen capsules and Jinhuaqinggan granules for mild conditions, and Xuebijing (injectable) for severe conditions.These drugs are widely used to treat COVID-19 in China. The official claimed the patent herbal drugs can effectively relieve symptoms, such as fever, cough, and fatigue, and reduce the probability of patients developing severe conditions, but without giving further details. So far, no high-quality, rigorously peer-reviewed clinical trials of herbal drugs have been reported in internationally recognised journals. The approvals, based on in-vitro investigations and anecdotal clinical data, will probably lead to several worrisome consequences.First, safety is the top priority. Advocates argue that herbal drugs are widely used and safe, but the truth is that all drugs carry risks. In the 1990s, Vanherweghem and colleagues reported that some women who followed a slimming herbal remedy developed rapidly progressive renal failure and urothelial carcinoma. Further investigations highlighted the role of aristolochic acid, a compound found in many traditional herbs. Certain batches of an injectable herbal drug called Xiyanping, which is recommended by the Chinese Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol of COVID-19, have already been recalled after reports of adverse effects.Although these patent herbal drugs have been used clinically for several years, when we apply them to a novel disease like COVID-19, especially in combination with other antivirals, antibiotics, and immune suppressants, the safety should be cautiously evaluated.
Second, more evidence is required through controlled clinical trials to support the efficacy of these herbal drugs. Many traditional medicine practitioners believe that herbal remedies cannot be tested because they are tailored to each individual's syndromes. This argument is simply not convincing. Because the patent herbal drugs are produced in advance of any treatment and their composition is fixed, clinical endpoints including mortality, time to clinical improvement, and number of days in an intensive care unit can be used to evaluate the efficacy of the herbal drugs for COVID-19. Standardised trials might have methodological challenges, consuming time and effort, but that should not be the reason for lowering safety and efficacy standards. Thousands of years of usage and faith cannot be taken as evidence for efficacy of traditional herbs.Third, the basic molecular mechanism is obscure. Lianhuaqingwen capsules have been shown to have wide-spectrum antiviral effects and anti-inflammatory activities, but the active ingredients and the underlying mechanism of action are unknown. Herbal drugs usually contain many active ingredients, and it is important to better understand which ingredients are functional, and how they work. Limited experimental cell cultures and animal studies cannot guarantee safety and efficacy.Finally, the public can easily purchase herbal drugs without a doctor's prescription. Driven by the claim that some patent herbal drugs can effectively treat COVID-19, some patients with flu symptoms who fear quarantine measures are likely to self-medicate with herbal remedies and avoid going to hospital, thus delaying the proper diagnosis and treatment of the disease, and hampering the government's testing, tracing, and quarantining efforts. At the end of January, 2020, rumours circulating on social media suggested that a patent herbal drug called Shuanghuanglian, which contains honeysuckle and forsythia and is used routinely in traditional medicine to treat influenza and the common cold, helps ward off or even cure COVID-19. Millions of people nationwide crowded into drug stores to buy the herbal drug as a just-in-case remedy.The current COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for the Chinese Government and the general public. Doctors and researchers are desperately seeking a proven cure for it. When the conventional drugs such as lopinavir, ritonavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine are not as effective as expected,8,  9 screening potential active components from traditional herbal medicine is a viable strategy that should not be dismissed. My colleagues and I have previously called for more attention to testing traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of COVID-19,10 but a rushed judgment without sufficient scientific evidence should be cautioned against.Given the formidable morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, it is understandable to see emergency use of unproven drugs, but the approval of a new indication for herbal drugs should still build on evidence. In the past decades, the Chinese Government has invested huge sums of money to promote the modernisation and standardisation of traditional medicine, carrying out sustainable basic and clinical research to get international recognition, but the rushed approval seems to be a backward step. The attempt to develop rigorously tested drugs from traditional herbal medicine should not be given up. It is the only way to protect our vulnerable patients.",1
"For the first time in the post-war history of epidemics, there is a reversal of which countries are most heavily affected by a disease pandemic. By early May, 2020, more than 90% of all reported deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been in the world's richest countries; if China, Brazil, and Iran are included in this group, then that number rises to 96%. The rest of the world—historically far more used to being depicted as the reservoir of pestilence and disease that wealthy countries sought to protect themselves from, and the recipient of generous amounts of advice and modest amounts of aid from rich governments and foundations—looks on warily as COVID-19 moves into these regions.Despite this reversal, however, the usual formula of dispensing guidance continues to be played out, with policies deemed necessary for the hardest-hit wealthy countries becoming a one-size-fits-all message for all countries. Two centrepieces of this approach are the use of widespread lockdowns to enforce physical distancing—although, it is notable that a few wealthy countries like Sweden and South Korea have not adopted this strategy—and a focus on sophisticated tertiary hospital care and technological solutions. We question the appropriateness of these particular strategies for less-resourced countries with distinct population structures, vastly different public health needs, immensely fewer health-care resources, less participatory governance, massive within-country inequities, and fragile economies. We argue that these strategies might subvert two core principles of global health: that context matters and that social justice and equity are paramount.Context is central to the control of any epidemic, a truism we've known for centuries but that we seem to have overlooked in this pandemic. Perhaps this is unsurprising given the colonial history of medicine, in which the illnesses that affected Europeans were assumed to have universal significance whereas those that affected the non-European populations who were colonised were relegated to “tropical medicine”. That context matters is obvious in the case of COVID-19. Low-income and lower-middle-income countries, clustered in sub-Saharan Africa and south and southeast Asia, have a different demographic profile from wealthy countries of the OECD and east Asia. Their populations are much younger and most older people live at home, not in care homes, where up to half of all deaths in wealthy countries have occurred. Just these variations in age structure and social arrangements account for lower risk of COVID-19 mortality in these populations. Yet lockdowns have been imposed in these countries.
The number of deaths from COVID-19 since the epidemic began is a tiny fraction of all deaths that have occurred due to any cause since the start of 2020. Thus, people continue to die in the millions of other diseases, and lockdowns have made accessing essential health care much more difficult in some places. In India, for example, public transport, the main way for the poor and many health-care workers to reach a health facility, has been barred since late March, although a limited restoration was announced on May 4, 2020. Not surprisingly, there have been dramatic reductions in essential public health and clinical interventions; data from India's National Health Mission indicate that there was a 69% reduction in measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination in children, a 21% reduction in institutional deliveries, a 50% reduction in clinic attendance for acute cardiac events and, surprisingly, a 32% fall in inpatient care for pulmonary conditions in March, 2020, compared with March, 2019. Similar reports are emerging from other countries, including disruptions to insecticide-treated net campaigns, access to antimalarial medicines, and suspension of polio vaccination.Twinned with lockdowns to achieve physical distancing is the promotion of widescale COVID-19 testing that relies on expensive kits and an emphasis on intensive-care units and ventilator capacity. These strategies, which have dominated much of the health-system response in rich countries, are a remote possibility in many low-resource contexts where access to intensive care or anything beyond basic diagnostics is far from universal. If COVID-19 vaccines are developed, history suggests they are likely to be available first in the countries that can afford to purchase them and only then will they trickle down to low-income countries, where they will reach the wealthy first. By contrast, there is barely any mention of the role of syndromic diagnosis (clinical diagnosis based on the constellation of symptoms and signs which are a hallmark of infection); the role of community health workers, primary care nurses, and doctors; and the role of community engagement. Constrained health-care systems already short of money, beds, equipment, and staff, are unlikely to be able to provide treatment for COVID-19 patients unless they reallocate scarce resources. And so, the combined effect of the reduced access to, and availability of, essential health care might lead to increases in deaths unrelated to COVID-19.A second key principle of global health is social justice and equity: the concerns of the poor who already bear a disproportionate burden of risk factors and disease must be at the centre of all decisions. Yet a one-size-fits-all approach to COVID-19 has not only been inequitable in its impact, but is also likely to increase inequalities in the long term. A stark example is the inequitable economic impact of lockdowns on people who barely survive on precarious livelihoods. About 2 billion people make their living in the informal economy, and over 90% of them live in low-income and low-middle-income countries. Hunger is an immediate threat to these people and their families, both due to the loss of daily wages and the disruption of the food supply chains. The UN has estimated that over 300 million children who rely on school meals for most of their nutritional needs might now be at risk of acute hunger, which could reverse the progress made in the past 2–3 years in reducing infant mortality within a year.Then there is the practical challenge of physical distancing and quarantining in urban slums and rural households where multiple people share a room and where toilets cater for many families. Lockdowns have been enforced with an increase in authoritarian behaviour of the police with the poor experiencing brutality and humiliation in countries such as India, Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. In sharp contrast, lockdowns are little more than an inconvenience for affluent people, who typically look to high-income countries as the model to shape their view of how society should respond to the pandemic.What then should these countries do, especially as some of them begin to ease lockdown restrictions? Realistically, a community-based approach is needed that emphasises active case finding (through syndromic diagnosis where laboratory-confirmed diagnosis is not available) by community health workers and primary care providers, with contact tracing and home quarantining, especially early in an epidemic, engaging and enabling community resources with due attention to avoiding stigmatisation, and banning mass gatherings. District-level facilities for appropriate respiratory support that can be managed by locally available human resources, equipped with adequate personal protection, need to be developed as long-term assets for the health-care system. Lockdowns, if humanely planned and with the participation of the community affected, could be used sparingly to contain clusters of cases. Wearing masks at home for the ill person and caregiver, washing hands when possible, practising coughing etiquette, and physically distancing older people and those with comorbidities are a few of the non-intrusive interventions that are possible without disrupting the intrinsic fabric of society. Central to our proposals are the engagement and participation of all sections of the community, especially the poor and marginalised, as a mature and responsible citizenry, invoking their solidarity to be part of a shared endeavour, rather than seeing the goal of containing COVID-19 as a purely technocratic or law-and-order problem. Similar community-based strategies of social mobilisation and engagement were effective in reducing transmission of Ebola virus disease in west Africa.
Concurrently, we suggest that countries must let people get on with their lives—to work, earn money, and put food on the table. Let shop keepers open and sell their wares and provide services. Let construction workers return to building sites. Allow farmers to harvest their crops and to transport them to be sold on the open market. Allow health workers to do their daily work as before, with sensible precautions such as use of gloves and masks to minimise the risk of exposure to the virus. And allow the average citizen to travel freely with restrictions only applied to clusters where lockdowns are necessary. Livelihoods are an imperative for saving lives. Some will say such an approach, which runs the risk of spreading disease, implies that the lives of poor people are not as valuable as those in wealthy countries. Nothing could be further from the truth. The policies of widespread lockdowns and a focus on high-technology health care might unintentionally lead to even more sickness and death, disproportionately affecting the poor. And, if such policies are mandated by global consensus, then global financial institutions must write off outstanding debts from low-income countries and finance the needed resources to underwrite the economic recovery of these countries.
Key principles of global health are context and equity. We urge less-resourced countries to devise policies that speak to their unique demographics, diverse social conditions and cultures, precarious livelihoods, and constrained infrastructure and resources. A focus is needed on what is possible, acceptable, just, and sustainable. Given that substantial financial support from wealthy countries—in contrast to technical guidance—is unlikely, low-resource countries need to rely on their own home-grown expertise, grassroots experience, and community resources to chart a way through this crisis. In addition to being aligned with the founding principles of global health, such policies would adhere to a principle of the Hippocratic Oath “primum non nocere”—”first do no harm”.",0
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread globally despite unprecedented social isolation and restrictions resulting in widespread economic decline. More than 3·2 million people have been infected and more than 230 000 of them have died. To date, no treatments have been definitively shown to be effective; however, a multipronged approach to mitigate transmission, morbidity, and mortality is ongoing. While upstream prevention strategies such as vaccination are ideal, these strategies are unlikely to be available in time to address current clinical need. Instead, fast-tracking of drug development and repurposing of approved drugs has facilitated and expedited clinical trials that might hasten effective therapeutics. Many of these drugs act, at least in part, to directly limit viral replication. By contrast, the use of interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibition might have benefits by controlling the pathological immune response to the virus. Here, we expand on the theoretical basis of IL-6 inhibition and propose potential benefits from other immunomodulators that could, in theory, prove more efficacious.For the latter phase of convalescence, hospitalised patients with COVID-19 can develop a syndrome of dysregulated and systemic immune overactivation described as a cytokine storm or hyperinflammatory syndrome that worsens acute respiratory distress syndrome and can lead to multisystem organ failure.The scarce systematic data available have shown an association between ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, IL-1, d-dimer, and C-reactive protein and severe disease. If this group can be identified before decompensation, early and aggressive immunomodulatory treatment might prevent need for intubation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. To date, observational studies suggest a possible benefit but results of placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials are not yet available. Given the methodological limitations of existing studies, more evidence is needed. With the rapidly expanding number of critically ill patients, there is an urgent need to identify multiple putative biological targets. While IL-6 inhibition attenuates key aspects of the cytokine cascade, we posit other immune targets of inhibition to be considered and their potential to be more efficacious in the setting of COVID-19, specifically IL-1 inhibitors and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors.Observational data show overlapping clinical features in severe COVID-19 with macrophage activating syndrome (MAS) and secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Hyperinflammatory states, specifically in fatal cases, highlight why consideration of HLH and MAS therapies are warranted. Furthermore, the pathogenesis underlying SARS-CoV-2 involves several key pathways that can be manipulated, and use of these therapies can mitigate the propagation of an overdriven inflammatory response (figure).Although few patients with severe COVID-19 would meet criteria for MAS, it is proposed that they are on the spectrum and that MAS or secondary HLH therapies might be of benefit. IL-1 inhibitors are key therapeutics in the treatment of MAS or secondary HLH, but also boast an impressive safety profile with risk for infection and demonstrated safety when used in pregnant women and children. By inhibiting IL-1 signalling, they reduce a prominent drive on NF-κB-mediated upregulation of multiple cytokines, including IL-6. Additionally, a post-hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial in sepsis indicated that patients with sepsis who had features of transaminitis and coagulopathy, a phenotype emerging within the COVID-19 population, might uniquely benefit from IL-1 inhibition. Ongoing clinical trials using IL-1, IL-6, or JAK inhibitors in COVID-19 are listed in the appendix.JAK inhibitors can treat a cytokine storm by inhibiting multiple inflammatory cytokines. Most JAK inhibitors are particularly effective at JAK 1 and JAK 2 inhibition—less so JAK 3 and TYK 2—and therefore are particularly effective at inhibition of IL-6 and interferon (IFN)-γ, but also inhibit IL-2 and the IFN-α/β signalling cascade. Most JAK inhibitors have been associated with increased risk for thrombosis, viral reactivation, and myelosuppression. However, these adverse effects (except myelosuppression) are likely to be dependent on duration and dose. As with IL-1 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors generally have short half-lives and can have efficacy within days. These characteristics are favourable given that duration of use in patients with COVID-19 should be short term. Ruxolitinib, a JAK 1/2 inhibitor, received US Food and Drug Administration approval for steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease, a frequently fatal complication of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation characterised by unconstrained inflammation and tissue damage. Off label, it has also effectively managed inflammatory complications in patients with genetic disorders that result in overactivity of the STAT1 pathway and in resistant MAS or secondary HLH of multiple causes, including viral. Further understanding of the complex crosstalk that occurs, involving both viral and host survival strategies, might identify the need to target multiple different mechanisms to safely balance viral destruction while promoting host survival. Clinical trials will be key in determining these effects across a potential heterogeneous population, while simultaneously monitoring the side-effect profile of these drugs to ensure any potential benefits are not outweighed by harms.
In conclusion, as insight is gained into the clinical phenotypes associated with COVID-19, we propose JAK and IL-1 inhibitors as therapeutic targets warranting rapid investigation. Multidisciplinary collaboration with experts in haematology, inflammation, tissue damage, and repair and resolution is paramount.

"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is raising levels of anxiety worldwide: both appropriate anxiety in reaction to real dangers and maladaptive panic. Beyond handwashing, a key public health directive is social distancing, which entails avoiding public gatherings and generally keeping physical distance from others. The economy is shutting down, leaving people at home without the structure of their daily work routine. The closing of theatres, museums, restaurants, and bars has disrupted and diminished social life. Rapid shifts in information (and misinformation) about a previously unknown pathogen amplify ongoing uncertainty and anxiety. Social distancing seems to mean increasing social isolation while worrying about a potentially lethal illness. Isolation can easily translate to loss of social support, particularly for individuals who live alone; and loss of social support often compounds symptom severity.The current crisis is transforming both our society and our practice. This situation has large implications for psychotherapy, and perhaps particularly for interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Overnight, psychotherapy has changed from in-person treatment to teletherapy, which maintains the therapist–patient alliance despite the emotional and hygienic distancing of a computer or smartphone screen. Teletherapy is functional, but is not exactly like being in the same room with another person. In IPT, we generally aspire to have patients look up from their screens to make eye contact, but now we distance. Now talking heads might be the safest substitute for personal encounters.Whereas other treatments like psychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy have intrapsychic targets, IPT focuses on the interpersonal arena. IPT therapists usually encourage patients to interact with others. Social contact is already a challenge for depressed and anxious patients, and it has just become far more complicated. It is not a good time to join a social group or meet new individuals. So how should therapists handle the current crisis? Recent virtual supervisions and treatments have offered the following suggestions.Address reality. The first step is to acknowledge the extraordinary situation. To strengthen the therapeutic alliance, therapists can be clear that we would rather meet in person, but that in this public health emergency that is not a good idea. The therapist might want to privately recognise his or her countertransference, which might well include relief at avoiding infection by maintaining a distance. The message to the patient, however, needs to convey that the therapist will stay in touch and continue working to help the patient get better, the crisis notwithstanding. Indeed, isolated patients need a lifeline now more than ever. Try to maintain a regular schedule, and have the patient find a space where he or she will not be overheard or interrupted. It is important to try to use Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-approved media to make eye contact through the screen. Give the patient your full empathic attention; do not take notes during sessions. The therapeutic alliance could have particular potency in a time of crisis.Social support. Similarly, the patient's social interaction presents a dilemma. It is important to make the most of social engagement given the limitations of the moment, to maintain social bonds, and to seek interpersonal support even as one must maintain a safe physical distance. Social engagement—attachment—is a basic human need. At a time when developing new relationships might be hard, taking a good interpersonal inventory can identify existing relationships that the patient can use to minimise isolation. The phone, FaceTime, Skype, and the like can help to lessen social isolation and maintain social support. Failing that strategy, more isolated individuals might want to use social media to maintain a sense of connection with others.Because most new therapies require in-person intake visits, a patient you terminate with is unlikely to be able to start new treatment elsewhere. Hence, even if you were planning to terminate a time-limited treatment with a patient, it might be appropriate—depending upon clinical status—to add continuation sessions to a treatment you would normally end, in order to ensure the patient's continuity of care.Every cloud has a silver lining. Objectively, this situation is a terrible moment in world history, and not one to trivialise to patients. From a therapeutic stance, however, bad news can be good news. IPT therapists capitalise on environmental stressors and losses—the death of a significant other (complicated bereavement), a painful interpersonal situation (role dispute), or other major life event (role transition)—as helpful explanations for why patients are feeling the way they do, contextualising those feelings and symptoms in a current personal crisis that the patient can work on and resolve in time-limited treatment.A pandemic can helpfully be reframed as a role transition in which the patient needs to mourn the (hopefully temporary) loss of old roles and to adaptively restructure activities and relationships in the present. Forty years ago, another frightening and initially untreatable virus with very different course, stigma, and social reverberations struck. Because the news was so bad, IPT proved particularly efficacious in treating HIV-related major depression, and might have similar potency today.This setting is a painful but powerful moment for psychotherapy. Patients need therapy more than ever, yet are physically distanced from it. Psychotherapy might be harder in some respects to do at a distance, but teletherapy does work, and the basic principles remain the same. The interpersonal, environmental context can provide a useful frame for treating the problems patients now face.JM reports personal fees from Oxford University Press, American Psychiatric Publication, and Basic Books; and support from a grant from the Bob Woodruff Foundation, outside the submitted work.",1
"Among all the reports, modelling, and desktop exercises in the past decade devoted to preparing for the next pandemic, when COVID-19 spread worldwide, some of the consequences had surely never been predicted. Scientists who were barely known outside a narrow academic circle are now household names, lauded and vilified in turn in the press and on social media. Twitter subscribers who until a few months ago were apparently experts in European relations or constitutional law are now skilled infectious diseases epidemiologists. The accretion of new knowledge takes place via tweets, political grandstanding, gross misinterpretation of preprints, and media briefings in the absence of scrutinisable data. We are witness to the unedifying spectacle of highly respected scientists left squirming as they are subject to the dangerous ramblings of politicians desperate to rescue themselves from their own incompetence. Politically inspired crank conspiracy theories abound as to the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Perhaps more predictably, the steps taken by national governments to mitigate COVID-19 are simultaneously criticised as under-reactions and over-reactions. And as these policies have their desired effect, the premature clamour for a “return to normal” grows ever louder.
Whereas policy decisions in response to COVID-19 are labelled as being “guided by the science”, there are many aspects of this disease that affect policy where scientific consensus has yet to form. For example, there has been much discussion of whether immunity from natural infection will protect against repeat infections. Experience with other coronaviruses suggests that although protective immunity does develop, it also wanes. If true for SARS-CoV-2, the effect on policy around so-called “immunity passports” is unclear. At the very least, people who can go about their business because of their immune status will need to be retested frequently.The value of wearing face masks remains unclear in our view. As part of the relaxing of physical distancing restrictions, governments are recommending face covering while on public transport or shopping. Given that we can be confident that domestic and workplace settings are more likely venues for virus transmission than travel or casual urban contact, then, logically, advice to wear facial covering while travelling to work should extend to the workplace itself.Many governments have implemented school closures as part of the pandemic response. The contribution of this measure to transmission control relative to other policies is fiercely disputed. Staged, carefully monitored reopening of schools might be necessary to gather information to guide long-term policy.What was predicted from previous outbreaks is the effect that the response to COVID-19 is having on management of other diseases. In our May issue, we reported that the pandemic has disrupted both routine and mass vaccination campaigns in some low-income and middle-income countries, and the same is now happening with infant immunisation in the USA and the UK. A recent report estimates that compared with a scenario of no pandemic, the demands that the COVID-19 response puts on health systems will increase deaths by up to 10% for HIV, 20% for tuberculosis, and 36% for malaria over 5 years in high-burden settings. The pandemic response is already affecting care for non-communicable diseases, and the resultant economic downturn will have chronic long-term health effects, with mental health perhaps worst affected.Policy responses must account for scientific uncertainties, while at the same time balancing the demands that COVID-19 puts on health-care resources with the long-term economic and health effects of pandemic control measures. Among industrialised, densely populated countries, Germany and South Korea in particular have been praised for their responses to COVID-19, which have been based on widespread testing, contact tracing, and isolation. But the virus has not gone away in these places—there are worrying signs of an increase in cases as restrictions are eased. The percentage of the global population that is immune from exposure to the disease is probably still in single figures; future outbreaks are almost inevitable.
A reshaping of policy is required that accounts for a reluctantly forming consensus: that we must plan for COVID-19 over years rather than months. Even with an effective vaccine in the next year, global roll-out will take at least as long again. Policies must be internationally coordinated, as WHO has called for since the disease first appeared, and must recognise that neither abandoning control nor eternal lockdown are healthy options.",1
"In December, 2019, the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing COVID-19, a respiratory disease presenting with fever, cough, and often pneumonia. WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates.
Methods.A case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for ≥15 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts). High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms. We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods. Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs.Patient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations. Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4. The median incubation period was 4·0 days (IQR 2·3–4·3) and the median serial interval was 4·0 days (3·0–5·0). Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown. One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase. Secondary attack rates were 75·0% (95% CI 19·0–99·0; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10·0% (1·2–32·0; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5·1% (2·6–8·9; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts.Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial. Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and 0-negative tests occurred. These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.",1
"Could the pandemic of the century have been averted? The process by which WHO decides whether to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations has drawn criticism. Reports have condemned the 4-month delay by WHO after the international spread of Ebola in west Africa before declaring a PHEIC.1 The Democratic Republic of the Congo, now experiencing the second largest Ebola outbreak in recorded history, notified WHO of the outbreak on Aug 1, 2018, but WHO required four Emergency Committee meetings, including on Oct 17, 2018 (216 confirmed cases, 139 deaths, and 64% case fatality ratio), and April 12 and June 14, 2019 (four confirmed cases in Uganda). Justifying their response, the Emergency Committee said that “the cluster of cases in Uganda is not unexpected”. A PHEIC was finally declared at the fourth Emergency Committee meeting on July 17, 2019 (2501 cases and 1668 deaths), almost a year after initial notification. The International Health Regulations do not require actual international spread, only a high potential for that spread, and thus the criteria for a PHEIC had already been met by the second Emergency Committee meeting.4 Notably, the PHEIC declaration coincided with increased resourcing and international focus, leading to a major reduction in Ebola cases.Global health scholars have criticised the Emergency Committee process as lacking transparency, using “irrelevant considerations, undue influence and political interference”, and delaying declaration when International Health Regulations criteria have been met.The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak originating in China and reported to WHO on Dec 31, 2019, suggests that little has changed. The PHEIC declaration for COVID-19 occurred well after most public health experts had concluded that this outbreak posed a major international threat. At the first Emergency Committee meeting on Jan 22, 2020 (309 cases and six deaths reported in mainland China; five confirmed cases in four countries or territories), the Emergency Committee said it did not have key facts from China. It extended the meeting to the next day, when cases had risen to 571, with 17 deaths and ten cases in seven other countries or territories. Yet, the Emergency Committee could not achieve consensus, and the Director-General concluded that the outbreak was “an emergency in China, but it had not yet become a global health emergency”.Again, the process appeared “more political than technical”, as a Lancet Editorial described Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, adding that “the committee seems to have favoured local protectiveness over global galvanising”.7 By the time the Emergency Committee declared a PHEIC for COVID-19 on Jan 30, 2020, 7736 cases and 179 deaths had been confirmed in mainland China, with 107 cases confirmed in 21 other countries.Delays in declaring a PHEIC could have serious detrimental consequences, lulling governments and donors into a 0 sense of security, because they could reason that if WHO does not consider the situation an international emergency, then it does not require a surge response.The legal definition of a PHEIC is clear, as “an extraordinary event that may constitute a public health risk to other countries through international spread of disease and may require an international coordinated response.” The purpose of the declaration is to focus international attention on acute public health risks that “require coordinated mobilisation of extraordinary resources by the international community” for prevention and response.
The PHEIC process requires urgent reform. First, the all-or-nothing nature of the assessment generates confusion. We therefore propose a multilevel PHEIC process with each level defined by objective epidemiological criteria and paired with specific readiness actions. Level 1 PHEIC alert should indicate a high risk outbreak in a single country, with the potential for international spread requiring concerted public health efforts to contain and manage it locally. Level 2 PHEIC should imply that multiple countries have had importations and that limited spread has occurred in those countries. Level 3 PHEIC would indicate large clusters in multiple countries, with evidence of ongoing local transmission. This tiering would provide less ambiguous risk signalling, while also encouraging earlier, proportionate public health measures when they are most effective.Second, WHO should convene an expert consensus meeting to establish objective, evidence-based epidemiological and containment criteria to transparently guide its decision making processes. The draft algorithm under Annex 2 of the International Health Regulations8 (appendix) already includes critical elements, but there are also subjective considerations, such as restraints on international travel and trade. The algorithm contains perverse relative weightings, treating the five categories as equivalent.The clear purpose of a PHEIC declaration is to catalyse timely evidence-based action, to spur increased international funding and support, and to limit the public health and societal impacts of emerging and re-emerging disease risks. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, International Health Regulation reform must be an ethical imperative for more rapid and effective responses to novel infectious diseases.",1
"When WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on Jan 30, 2020, under the provisions of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), it recommended against “any travel or trade restriction”.The recommendation was based on data available at the time, evidence from previous outbreaks, and principles underpinning the IHR. It formed an important part of WHO's messaging about how states could effectively respond in a coordinated way. Instead, over the following months, according to WHO, 194 countries adopted some form of cross-border measure—eg, travel restrictions, visa restrictions, border closures, among others—with little reproach from WHO or other actors in the international community. This response is a sharp increase from at most 25% of member states that imposed trade and travel restrictions during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2013–16 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in west Africa. Indeed, WHO's recommendation against measures such as travel restrictions and border closures became a point of criticism of the organisation's role at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.The universal adoption of cross-border measures raises fundamental questions about what coordination means during a pandemic, and what role WHO has in facilitating this. Coordinated action among states in an interconnected world underpins effective prevention, detection, and control of disease outbreaks across countries. As parties to the IHR, governments agree that coordination is important to ensure that measures do not unnecessarily disrupt international trade and travel. Thus, during major disease outbreaks, part of WHO's role is to provide evidence-informed guidance on cross-border measures.A wider range of cross-border measures have been adopted by countries during the COVID-19 pandemic than in past disease outbreaks. Not all these measures fall under the IHR, but patterns of adoption point to several knowledge gaps. First, what measures have been adopted over time and space not only by member states but also by commercial companies such as airlines and cruise ships? Companies do not fall under the remit of the IHR, but their actions have had clear consequences. There is a need to track the full range of cross-border measures (panel) adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the specific requirements they impose, and, for member states, consistency with the IHR.",1
"We read with interest the report by Blanco and colleagues of five people living with HIV who were admitted to a Barcelona hospital with COVID-19. We believe that caution is required before drawing conclusions on the outcome of COVID-19 in this population.Evidence is evolving that protease inhibitors developed for the treatment of HIV, both lopinavir and darunavir boosted by ritonavir or cobicistat, are not efficacious against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in vivo.Therefore, antiretroviral combinations should not be changed in an attempt to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, because neither drug combination is a first-line choice in most guidelines for HIV and changing treatment could lead to increased rates of adverse events.Antiretroviral treatments such as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and integrase inhibitors have better tolerability than boosted protease inhibitors. Moreover, three of the five cases described by Blanco and colleagues were initiated or switched to an antiretroviral combination containing a pharmacokinetic booster, thereby introducing a substantial risk of significant drug-drug interactions. New antiviral drugs active against COVID-19 are being developed, and interactions of such drugs with antiretrovirals can be seen frequently. For example, remdesivir might interact with carbamazepine and other drug metabolism inducers, and no data are available on potential interactions with nucleoside analogues used in antiretroviral combinations.Caution is needed when interpreting the incidence of COVID-19 in people living with HIV compared with the HIV-negative population. The numbers reported by Blanco and colleagues are small and patients attended only one hospital, so the sample is subject to bias. The authors do not report on the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who were tested for HIV infection. Without universal HIV testing, it is not possible to calculate the incidence of the two viral infections occurring in the same individual simultaneously.The statement that only 1% of people admitted with COVID-19 to one hospital in Barcelona had HIV can be misinterpreted and 0ly reassuring, particularly while we still do not entirely understand which populations should be protected from COVID-19 by social interventions, such as shielding, self-isolation, and frequent testing. In the UK, large cohort studies are being done to investigate the true rate of infection, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19 in people with HIV.Challenges in understanding the true frequency of COVID-19 in people with HIV include the overall limited testing that has happened so far, particularly for patients not needing hospitalisation, the admission of patients in hospitals external to where the individual might access their HIV care, and the fact that people with HIV might be more vigilant at shielding and self-isolation because of the propagation of fears of higher acquisition rates and a poorer outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people living with HIV.Finally, appropriately powered and designed studies are needed to draw conclusions on the effect of COVID-19 in people with chronic diseases, including HIV infection. HIV infection is itself characterised by various clinical scenarios, ranging from viral suppression and good quality of life to HIV-associated comorbidities or virological failure with or without immunosuppression.RJ received grants from ViiV and MSD and personal fees from Gilead.

"There is a simple but crucial number at the heart of understanding the threat posed by the coronavirus. It is guiding governments around the world on the actions needed to save lives and to lift lockdown.It is called the reproduction number, or simply the R value.What is R?The reproduction number is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread.It's the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average.Measles has one of the highest numbers in town with a reproduction number of 15 in populations without immunity. It can cause explosive outbreaks.The new coronavirus, known officially as Sars-CoV-2, has a reproduction number of about three, but estimates vary.How is R calculated?You cannot capture the moment people are infected; instead scientists work backwards.Using data - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus - allows you to estimate how easily the virus is spreading.Generally this gives a picture of what the R number was two to three weeks ago. Regular testing of households should soon give a more timely estimate.Why is a number above one dangerous?If the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially - it snowballs like debt on an unpaid credit card.But if the number is lower, the disease will eventually peter out, as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.Governments everywhere want to force the reproduction number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one.This is the reason you've not seen family, have had to work from home and the children have been off school - stopping people coming into contact with each other to cut the virus's ability to spread.What is the R number in the UK?
The reproduction number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes, or as immunity develops.
Mathematical modellers at Imperial College London are attempting to track how the number has changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced.Before any measures came in, the number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one.The R value in the UK has crept up recently and is now thought to be between 0.7 and 1.0.Counter-intuitively, this increase is probably due to the success in slowing the virus in society as a whole. As cases collapse in the community, the R value is largely reflecting what is happening in care homes.Does R vary across the UK?The R number has come down across every part of the UK since the start of the epidemic.But multiple research groups, including those at the University of Cambridge, show it has come down the most in London. It is proving far more stubborn in the north-east of England.Those figures are more optimistic than other groups' calculations. Similar work by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine puts the number for London at 0.6, and the south-west at 0.9.It also showed the R-values were 0.8 in Wales, and 1 in both Scotland and Northern Ireland.So how does this inform lifting lockdown?As any country thinks about how to lift lockdown, the aim will be to keep the reproduction number below one.Dr Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC: ""It's a big challenge making sure you're not loosening too much and increasing transmission.""However it has taken a monumental effort, one that has caused damage to people's lives, to get the number from three to 0.7.""It doesn't give you a lot of room to play with to keep the number below one"", Dr Kucharski added.Which measures could be lifted?Unfortunately, there is no confirmation of how much each intervention affects the virus's spread, although there are estimates.""Opening schools versus workplaces versus other gatherings - understanding how much they increase the reproduction number, is going to be the challenge,"" said Dr Kucharski.Another issue is that people's behaviour changes over time, so the number can creep up even if lockdown policies remain unchanged.What is likely to be needed are new ways of controlling the virus, such as more extensive testing and tracing or location-tracking apps.These can suppress the reproduction number in a more targeted way, allowing some of the other measures to be lifted.Is it the most important number?The reproduction number is one of the big three.Another is severity - if you have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems, then you can relax a bit. Coronavirus, and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly, unfortunately.The last is the number of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases.What about a vaccine?Having a vaccine is another way to bring down the reproduction number.A coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one.",1
"Loss of smell or taste have been added to the UK's list of coronavirus symptoms that people should be aware of and ready to act upon.What are the coronavirus symptoms?Scientific advisers told the UK government to update its advice. It now says the symptoms to look out for are:A new, continuous cough.Fever.Loss of smell or taste.If you, or someone you live with, has any of these symptoms the advice is stay at home to stop the risk of giving coronavirus to others.The cough is a new, continuous one, where you cough a lot for more than an hour, or have three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours. You have a fever if your temperature is above 37.8C.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of symptoms also includes chills, repeated shaking, muscle pain and sore throat.It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, but some people will get them much later. The World Health Organization says incubation lasts up to 14 days.When do people need to go to hospital?The majority of people with coronavirus will recover after rest and pain relief (such as paracetamol).The main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing.Doctors may scan the lungs to see how badly they are affected and give support, such as oxygen or ventilation, if needed.However, people should not go to A&E if they are concerned. In the UK, the NHS 111 website will guide you through what to do.If you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words you will be told to call 999, as this is a medical emergency.If you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then it will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling NHS 111.What happens in intensive care?Intensive care units are specialist wards for people who are very ill.Coronavirus patients will get oxygen support, which can involve using a facemask or a tube in the nose.The most invasive way - for the most seriously ill patients - is ventilation where air, with increased levels of oxygen, is pushed into the lungs via a tube in the mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat.What should I do if I have mild symptoms?Patients with mild symptoms should self-isolate at home for at least seven days.People are advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E.Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP.
If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate.The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public.Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women.Work to develop a vaccine is under way. How do I protect myself?The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water.Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth.So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important.
People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick.In England and Scotland, people are being advised to wear face masks in shops and on public transport to help prevent the spread of the virus.",1
"Scientists are learning more each day about the mysterious novel coronavirus and the symptoms of Covid-19, the disease it causes.Fever, cough and shortness of breath are found in the vast majority of all Covid-19 cases. But there are additional signals of the virus, some that are very much like cold or flu, and some that are more unusual.Any or all symptoms can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Here are 10 signs that you or a loved one may have Covid-19 -- and what to do to protect yourself and your family. Shortness of breath, Shortness of breath is not usually an early symptom of Covid-19, but it is the most serious. It can occur on its own, without a cough. If your chest becomes tight or you begin to feel as if you cannot breathe deeply enough to fill your lungs with air, that's a sign to act quickly, experts say.
""If there's any shortness of breath immediately call your health care provider, a local urgent care or the emergency department,"" said American Medical Association president Dr. Patrice Harris.""If the shortness of breath is severe enough, you should call 911,"" Harris added.The CDC lists other emergency warning signs for Covid-19 as a ""persistent pain or pressure in the chest,"" and ""bluish lips or face,"" which can indicate a lack of oxygen.Get medical attention immediately, the CDC says.Fever.Fever is a key sign of Covid-19. Because some people can have a core body temperature lower or higher than the typical 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), experts say not to fixate on a number.CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who is battling the virus from his home in New York, is one of those people.""I run a little cool. My normal temperature is 97.6, not 98.6. So, even when I'm at 99 that would not be a big deal for most people. But, for me, I'm already warm,"" Cuomo told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN Town Hall.Most children and adults, however, will not be considered feverish until their temperature reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius).""There are many misconceptions about fever,"" said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.""We all actually go up and down quite a bit during the day as much as half of a degree or a degree,"" Williams said, adding that for most people ""99.0 degrees or 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit is not a fever.""Don't rely on a temperature taken in the morning, said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. Instead, take your temperature in the late afternoon and early evening.""Our temperature is not the same during the day. If you take it at eight o'clock in the morning, it may be normal,"" Schaffner explained.""One of the most common presentations of fever is that your temperature goes up in the late afternoon and early evening. It's a common way that viruses produce fever.""Dry Cough.Coughing is another common symptom, but it's not just any cough.""It's not a tickle in your throat. You're not just clearing your throat. It's not just irritated,"" Schaffner explained.The cough is bothersome, a dry cough that you feel deep in your chest.""It's coming from your breastbone or sternum, and you can tell that your bronchial tubes are inflamed or irritated,"" Schaffner added.A report put out by the World Health Organization in February found over 33% of 55,924 people with laboratory confirmed cases of Covid-19 had coughed up sputum, a thick mucus sometimes called phlegm, from their lungs.Chills and body aches, ""The beast comes out at night,"" said Cuomo, referencing the chills, body aches and high fever that visited him on April 1.'It was like somebody was beating me like a pinata. And I was shivering so much that ... I chipped my tooth. They call them the rigors,"" he said from his basement, where he is quarantined from the rest of his family.""I was hallucinating. My dad was talking to me. I was seeing people from college, people I haven't seen in forever, it was freaky,"" Cuomo said.Not everyone will have such a severe reaction, experts say. Some may have no chills or body aches at all. Others may experience milder flu-like chills, fatigue and achy joints and muscles, which can make it difficult to know if it's flu or coronavirus that's to blame.One possible sign that you might have Covid-19 is if your symptoms don't improve after a week or so but actually worsen.Sudden confusion.Speaking of worsening signs, the CDC says a sudden confusion or an inability to wake up and be alert may be a serious sign that emergency care may be needed. If you or a loved one has those symptoms, especially with other critical signs like bluish lips, trouble breathing or chest pain, the CDC says to seek help immediately.Digestive issues.At first science didn't think diarrhea or other typical gastric issues that often come with the flu applied to the noval coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2. As more research on survivors becomes available, that opinion has changed.""In a study out of China where they looked at some of the earliest patients, some 200 patients, they found that digestive or stomach GI (gastrointestinal) symptoms were actually there in about half the patients,"" Gupta said on CNN's New Day news program.Overall, ""I think we're getting a little bit more insight into the types of symptoms that patients might have,"" Gupta said.The study described a unique subset of milder cases in which the initial symptoms were digestive issues such as diarrhea, often without fever. Those patients experienced delays in testing and diagnosis than patients with respiratory issues, and they took longer to clear the virus from their systems.Pink eye, Research from China, South Korea and other parts of the world indicate that about 1% to 3% of people with Covid-19 also had conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye.Conjunctivitis, a highly contagious condition when caused by a virus, is an inflammation of the thin, transparent layer of tissue, called conjunctiva, that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelid.But SARS-CoV-2 is just one of many viruses that can cause conjunctivitis, so it came as no real surprise to scientists that this newly discovered virus would do the same.Still, a pink or red eye could be one more sign that you should call your doctor if you also have other telltale symptoms of Covid-19, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath. Loss of smell and taste, In mild to moderate cases of coronavirus, a loss of smell and taste is emerging as one of the most unusual early signs of Covid-19.""What's called anosmia, which basically means loss of smell, seems to be a symptom that a number of patients developed,"" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on New Day.""It may be linked to loss of taste, linked to loss of appetite, we're not sure -- but it's clearly something to look out for,"" Gupta said. ""Sometimes these early symptoms aren't the classic ones.""""Anosmia, in particular, has been seen in patients ultimately testing positive for the coronavirus with no other symptoms,"" according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.A recent analysis of milder cases in South Korea found the major presenting symptom in 30% of patients was a loss of smell. In Germany, more than two in three confirmed cases had anosmia.It has long been known in medical literature that a sudden loss of smell may be associated with respiratory infections caused by other types of coronaviruses, so it wasn't a surprise that the novel coronavirus would have this effect, according to ENT UK (PDF), a professional organization representing ear, nose and throat surgeons in the United Kingdom.Is there anything you can do at home to test to see if you're suffering a loss of smell? The answer is yes, by using the ""jellybean test"" to tell if odors flow from the back of your mouth up through your nasal pharynx and into your nasal cavity. if you can pick out distinct flavors such as oranges and lemons, your sense of smell is functioning fine.Fatigue.For some people, extreme fatigue can be an early sign of the novel coronavirus. The WHO report found nearly 40% of the nearly 6,000 people with laboratory confirmed cases experienced fatigue.Just a few days into his quarantine, Cuomo was already exhausted by the fevers and body aches the disease brings.""I'm so lethargic that I can stare outside, and, like, an hour-and-a-half goes by,"" Cuomo told Gupta on Anderson Cooper 360. ""I think I took a 10-minute nap, and it was three and a half hours.""Fatigue may continue long after the virus is gone. Anecdotal reports from people who have recovered from Covid-19 say exhaustion and lack of energy continue well past the standard recovery period of a few weeks.Headache, sore throat, congestion.The WHO report also found nearly 14% of the almost 6,000 cases of Covid-19 in China had symptoms of headache and sore throat, while almost 5% had nasal congestion.Certainly not the most common signs of the disease, but obviously similar to colds and flu. In fact, many symptoms of Covid-19 can resemble the flu, including headaches and the previously mentioned digestive issues, body aches and fatigue. Still other symptoms can resemble a cold or allergies, such as a sore throat and congestion.Most likely, experts say, you simply have a cold or the flu -- after all, they can cause fever and cough too.So what should you do?""At this moment, the current guidance -- and this may change -- is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them"" with rest, hydration and the use of fever-reducing medications, said the AMA's Harris.That advice does not apply if you are over age 60, since immune systems weaken as we age or if you are pregnant. Anyone with concerns about coronavirus should call their healthcare provider, according to the CDC.It's unclear whether pregnant women have a greater chance of getting severely ill from coronavirus, but the CDC has said that women experience changes in their bodies during pregnancy that may increase their risk of some infections.In general, Covid-19 infections are riskier if you have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, chronic lung disease or asthma, heart failure or heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cancer (or are undergoing chemotherapy), kidney disease with dialysis, a body mass index (BMI) over 40 (extremely obese) or an autoimmune disorder.""Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness,"" the CDC advises.To be clear, you are at higher risk -- even if you are young -- if you have underlying health issues.""People under 60 with underlying illnesses, with diabetes, heart disease, immunocompromised or have any kind of lung disease previously, those people are more vulnerable despite their younger age,"" Schaffner said.A history of travel to an area where the novel coronavirus is widespread (and those parts of the world, including the US, are going up each day) is obviously another key factor in deciding if your symptoms may be Covid-19 or not.How to be evaluated
If you have no symptoms, please don't ask for testing or add to backlog of calls at testing centers, clinics, hospitals and the like, experts say.
""We do not test people with no symptoms because it's a resource issue,"" Schaffner said about the assessment center at Vanderbilt. ""However, we are emphasizing that people who have this small cluster of important symptoms -- fever and anything related to the lower respiratory tract such as cough and difficulty breathing -- reach out to be evaluated.""If you do have those three signs, where should you go?""If you have insurance and you're looking for a provider or someone to call or connect with, there's always a number on the back of your insurance card; or if you go online, there is information for patients,"" Harris said.""If you don't have insurance, you can start with the state health department or the local community health centers, those are officially known as federally qualified health centers,"" Harris advised, adding that some states have a 1-800 hotline number to call.""If there is a testing and assessment center near you, you can go there directly,"" Schaffer said. ""It's always good to notify them that you're coming. Otherwise, you need to call your healthcare provider and they will direct you what to do.""",1
"The patient had been relatively fine for the first 10 days he was down with Covid-19.Just 38, he didn't fit the description of people at high risk of complications from the new coronavirus.""He had mild pulmonary symptoms that he was just sitting at home with,"" said Dr. Sean Wengerter, a vascular surgeon in Pomona, New York. ""He had been diagnosed at an urgent care clinic and it was going fine at home. He just had a little cough.""Until one of Covid-19's surprising effects kicked in.""Then he just woke up with both his legs numb and cold and so weak he couldn't walk,"" said Wengerter, who is division chief of vascular surgery at Westchester Medical Center Health's Good Samaritan Hospital.Coronavirus can cause blood clots.This relatively young man had an aortic occlusion -- a big blood clot in the body's main artery, right above where it splits into two parts to run into each leg. Blood was not getting into the iliac arteries and his legs were being starved.It's an extremely dangerous development that can kill between 20% and 50% of patients, Wengerter said. ""It just doesn't usually happen in a 38-year-old,"" he told CNN.Quick diagnosis and a surgical procedure to slice open the arteries and scoop out the clot using a catheter saved the patient. ""We had two surgeons working simultaneously on him,"" Wengerter said.Doctors treating coronavirus patients are seeing a range of odd and frightening syndromes, including blood clots of all sizes throughout the body, kidney failure, heart inflammation and immune complications.""One thing that is both curious and evolving and frustrating is that this disease is manifesting itself in so many different ways,"" said Dr. Scott Brakenridge, an assistant professor on the acute care surgery team at the University of Florida College of Medicine.It can also cause multi-system organ failure
""In some cases it's having severe effects on the patient's ability to breathe, and in others it seems to be associated with development of multi-system organ failure -- when all your organs shut down. And now it's associated with immune effects in children.""While the new coronavirus is designated as a respiratory virus, it's clear that it is affecting some people throughout their bodies. The most obvious symptoms of infection are classic respiratory symptoms: fever, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.But the virus also seems to attack some organs directly. One of the most troubling is its assault on the lining of the blood vessels, which in turn causes unnatural blood clotting.""It seems like Covid, the virus, is creating a local inflammatory response that's leading to some of these thrombotic events,"" Wengerter said. ""This is happening because of the direct action of the virus on the arteries themselves.""Other teams of doctors have reported unusual strokes in younger patients, as well as pulmonary embolisms, the medical name for blood clots in the lungs.Pathologists are finding tiny blood clots in the smallest vessels, as well, said Dr. Oren Friedman, who has been taking care of Covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.""There's no debate -- the virus seems to affect thrombosis and seems to directly affect your blood vessels,"" Friedman told CNN. And that means it affects the whole body.""Obviously, every single organ in your body is fed by blood vessels, so if the virus affects your blood vessels, then you can have organ damage,"" he said.""It is a very confusing picture. It's going to take time to understand,"" Brakenridge said.It might cause children's immune systems to overreact.One of the most frightening syndromes that might be linked with Covid-19 is ""pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome."" New York City reports 52 cases, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday, and the New York State Department of Health says it is investigating 100 cases.It is characterized by persistent fever, inflammation, poor function in one or more organs, and other symptoms that resemble shock, a panel of pediatricians known as the International PICU-COVID-19 Collaboration says.""In some cases, children present with shock and some have features of Kawasaki disease, whereas others may present with signs of cytokine storm. In some geographic areas, there has been an uptick in Kawasaki disease cases in children who don't have shock,"" Boston Children's Hospital rheumatologist Dr. Mary Beth Son said. Kawasaki disease involves inflammation in the walls of medium-sized arteries and can damage the heart.It may be caused by an immune system response known as a cytokine storm, doctors say.""Your immune system is overreacting to the virus, and because these are inflammatory diseases, this overreaction can cause a Kawasaki-like disease,"" Dr. Glenn Budnick, a pediatrician in Pomona, New Jersey, said on CNN Newsroom Saturday.""It is even possible that the antibodies that children are making to SARS-CoV2 are creating an immune reaction in the body. Nobody knows,"" said Dr. Jane Newburger, a cardiologist on the Boston Children's panel and an expert on Kawasaki disease.Cytokine storm may also cause some of the lung damage and unusual blood clotting seen in adult patients, doctors said.
""There is other evidence that the virus really doesn't generate a strong immune response and actually it is suppressing the immune system,"" Brakenridge said. That would allow the virus to more directly attack organs.A study published in the journal Nature Medicine on Tuesday supported both theories.
Dr. Zheng Zhang and colleagues at Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China analyzed samples of immune cells taken from the lungs of nine coronavirus patients and found abnormally high levels of immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils, as well as immune signaling chemicals called cytokines and chemokines in the sicker patients. Sicker patients also had high levels of proliferating T-cells, another type of immune cell.But the patients with the most severe symptoms had lower numbers of CD8 T-cells, which directly kill virus-infected cells.Doctors say they are finding that various treatments can help control symptoms. Blood thinners can help control the unusual blood clotting, while immune blockers may help control the cytokine storm.It can cause 'Covid toes'.One last symptom that is puzzling -- but less troubling -- is known as ""Covid toes."" Patients are reporting red or purple swelling of their toes.It's possible the tiny blood clots associated with Covid-19 are causing it, doctors said.""One pattern of COVID toes that people are reporting is red lesions typically on the soles. It's possible that this is a skin reaction or caused by a small clog or micro clots in the blood vessels found in the toes,"" Cleveland Clinic pulmonologist Dr. Humberto Choi said on the clinic's website.It's not usually associated with any serious symptoms, Choi said.",1
"Randomly spraying open places is largely a waste of time and effort, health experts say.It can actually do more harm than good. “Spraying disinfectants can result in risks to the eyes, respiratory or skin irritation,” the World Health Organization said.“Spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces, such as streets or marketplaces, is also not recommended to kill the COVID-19 virus or other pathogens because disinfectant is inactivated by dirt and debris, and it is not feasible to manually clean and remove all organic matter from such spaces,” the WHO said.“Moreover, spraying porous surfaces, such as sidewalks and unpaved walkways, would be even less effective.” Besides, the ground isn’t typically a source of infection, the WHO said.",1
"While some UV light devices are used for hospital disinfection, UV light only kills germs under very specific conditions — including certain irradiation dosages and exposure times, the World Health Organization said.But UV light can also damage the body.Two factors are required for UV light to destroy a virus: intensity and time. If the light is intense enough to break apart a virus in a short time, it’s going to be dangerous to people, said Donald Milton, a professor at the University of Maryland.UVA and UVB light both damage the skin. UVC light is safer for skin, but it will damage tender tissue such as the eyes.And don’t be fooled by claims that hot weather will kill coronavirus.“You can catch COVID-19 no matter how sunny or hot the weather is,” the WHO said. “Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.”",1
"No. The US Food and Drug Administration says you don’t need to wash fresh produce with soap and water, but you should rinse it with plain water.
But it’s still important to wash your hands with soap and water frequently because we often touch our faces without realizing it. And that’s a very easy way for coronavirus to spread.You don’t have to worry about getting coronavirus by “eating” it, though. Even if coronavirus does get into your food, your stomach acid would kill it, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University.",1
"Coronavirus can stick to hair, said Dr. David Aronoff, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.Touching contaminated hair and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose could increase your risk of infection. “Like on the skin, this coronavirus is a transient hitchhiker that can be removed by washing,” Aronoff said.But that doesn’t mean you have to wash the hair on your head multiple times a day, said dermatologist Dr. Hadley King.That’s because “living hair attached to our scalps may be better protected by our natural oils that have some antimicrobial properties and may limit how well microbes can attach to the hair,” she said.“If you are going out into areas that could possibly be contaminated with viral particles, then it would be reasonable to wash the hair daily during the pandemic. But it’s not the same as hand washing – the virus infects us through our mucosal surfaces. If your hair is not falling into your face or you’re not running your fingers through it, then there is less of a risk.”If your hair does fall into your face, you may want to pull it back to minimize your risk, King said.As for facial hair, “washing at least daily if not more frequently is wise, depending on how often they touch their face,” Aronoff said.",1
"There have been some reports of animals infected by coronavirus — including two pets in New York and eight big cats at the Bronx Zoo.Most of those infections came from contact with people who had coronavirus, like a zoo employee who was an asymptomatic carrier.But according to the CDC, there is no evidence animals play a significant role in spreading the virus to humans. Therefore, at this time, routine testing of animals for Covid-19 is not recommended.As always, it’s best to wash your hands after touching an animal’s fur and before touching your face. And if your pet appears to be sick, call your veterinarian.",1
"“People can be contagious without symptoms. And in fact – a little bit strangely in this case — people tend to be the most contagious before they develop symptoms, if they’re going to develop symptoms,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.“They call that the pre-symptomatic period. So people tend to have more virus at that point seemingly in their nose, in their mouth. This is even before they get sick. And they can be shedding that virus into the environment.”Some people infected with coronavirus never get symptoms. But it’s easy for these asymptomatic carriers to infect others, said Dr. Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA’s School of Public Health.“When you speak, sometimes you’ll spit a little bit,” she said. “You’ll rub your nose. You’ll touch your mouth. You’ll rub your eyes. And then you’ll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.”That’s why health officials suggest everyone wear a face mask while in public.",1
"Without contact tracing, a pandemic could get much worse. Thousands of Americans could soon join the ranks of disease detectives in one of the most important battles against coronavirus.Contact tracing has helped slow or stop previous epidemics, such as the SARS and Ebola outbreaks. But it's never been more critical -- or more challenging -- than in this fight against coronavirus.Here's how contact tracing works and how it can employ Americans who were recently laid off:What exactly is contact tracing?Contact tracing tracks down anyone who might have been infected by a person who was recently diagnosed so those contacts can quarantine themselves and prevent further spread.""In contact tracing, public health staff work with a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the timeframe while they may have been infectious,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.""Contacts are provided with education, information, and support to understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, monitor themselves for illness, and the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they themselves do not feel ill.""It's an arduous task, but contact tracing has been credited with helping stop the SARS epidemic in 2004.But immediate action is needed, the CDC said. ""Communities must scale up and train a large contact tracer workforce and work collaboratively across public and private agencies to stop the transmission of COVID-19,"" the disease caused by novel coronavirus.Why is contact tracing so critical right now?
Researchers say the US -- or really any country -- can't safely reopen without significant amounts of contact tracing and testing.
Without them, ""We're going to be at risk of resurgence of this disease -- not just in the fall, but going into next year,"" said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.How does the process work?Coronavirus survivor Amy Driscoll got a call from her county health department two hours after she got home from the hospital.A long list of questions followed: ""Who have I seen in the last two weeks? Where was I in the last two weeks? Who was I in contact with? Where do I work?"" Driscoll recalled.
After that, her coworkers in Ohio had to be contacted. So did a restaurant where she had gone for lunch. And a hair salon that she had visited. And also those who sat near her at a Cleveland Cavaliers game.But when contacts are notified, they aren't told who was diagnosed with coronavirus.""To protect patient privacy, contacts are only informed that they may have been exposed to a patient with the infection,"" the CDC says. ""They are not told the identity of the patient who may have exposed them.""How do people get notified?Contact tracers use a variety of methods, including phone calls, emails and social media messaging.Some places are getting creative. In North Dakota, health officials partnered with the creator of an app used to track bison to launch a new app called Care19.Those who download Care19 will get a random ID number, ""and the app will anonymously cache the individual's locations throughout the day,"" the North Dakota coronavirus response website says.""If an individual tests positive for COVID-19, they will be given the opportunity to consent to provide their information to the NDDoH to help in contact tracing and forecasting the pandemic's progression with accurate, real-time data.""Apple and Google are developing new contact tracing technology using smartphones and Bluetooth technology to alert those who may have been close to someone infected.But there are limitations to that new technology. Users would have to opt-in, and it's not clear whether enough people will do so to make the effort worthwhile. And people without smartphones would not get notified.How many contact tracers are there?""The total number of existing disease detectives in the United States (was) only 2,200"" before the coronavirus outbreak, said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors.About 1,600 of those disease detectives are members of the coalition, which is funded by the CDC and typically combats the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.But most of them have been redeployed to do contact tracing for coronavirus, Harvey said.""Any time there's an infectious disease outbreak, they get redeployed to Zika, Ebola, food-borne illness outbreaks,"" Harvey said. ""This is an essential public health workforce.""Do we have enough contact tracers?No. A study released by Johns Hopkins University estimates the US needs at least 100,000 additional public health workers to help with contact tracing.And that might be a low estimate, said Anita Cicero, deputy director at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and a co-author of the study. She said the US will likely need more than 100,000, but that's a good start to help the more heavily impacted areas.Former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said the US could need ""several hundred thousand"" contact tracers.The problem: ""Both state public health and county local public health do not have the resources or the people that are needed to be able to do contact tracing for all identified cases,"" Cicero said.But funding from the CARES Act is expected to pay for thousands more contact tracers, Harvey said. That could help some of the many Americans laid off during the coronavirus pandemic.How do I apply to become a contact tracer?Applicants can go to Contrace.org to submit their information.""CONTRACE Public Health Corps is a national database of over 50,000 qualified contact tracer applicants,"" founder and CEO Steve Waters said.""The information is shared with organizations hiring contact tracing teams throughout the US.""Harvey said you can also check your state health department's website and the CDC Foundation's website for contact tracing job opportunities.What education do you need to be a contact tracer?""It is helpful to have a public health or health care background,"" Harvey said. Fluency in multiple languages is also a plus.But ""no matter what your background, you can be trained to do this work,"" Harvey said.Different state or local health departments might have different requirements. The CDC Foundation's job posting requires a bachelor's degree for contact tracing candidates.How much do contact tracers get paid?""Contact tracers are not paid enough,"" Harvey said. ""The average salary in the United States is $35,000 a year.""But it is not yet clear how much newly hired contact tracers will make in different parts of the country.What do contact tracers say to those who might have been exposed?Sensitivity is important, since it's not easy for people to hear they might have been infected with coronavirus, Harvey said.""A person will typically be told, 'You may have been exposed. We recommend that you isolate for the next 14 days. Here's where you can get a test. What questions can I answer for you? Tell me folks that you've had sustained closed proximity with, and together we'll work to notify these people,'"" he said.
Who's leading contact tracing across the US?There's no central agency overseeing all the contact tracing -- rather, it's a mix of state and local health departments, nonprofits, private entities and universities.One of the biggest programs involves New York state, New Jersey, Connecticut, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the Resolve to Save Lives Initiative and Bloomberg Philanthropies, which has committed $10.5 million to a new contact tracing program.In Massachusetts, the Boston-based nonprofit Partners in Health is partnering with the state health department to boost contact tracing.And in San Francisco, the public health department has partnered with the University of California, San Francisco and DIMAGI, a company working with the CDC to digitize workflow and monitoring.Why is contact tracing for coronavirus so difficult?This novel coronavirus is highly contagious -- about twice as contagious as the flu when there's no social distancing orders. The Johns Hopkins study estimates each person with coronavirus infects another two or three other people, making it very difficult to find everyone who could be infected.
This coronavirus can also be spread by asymptomatic people who don't look or feel sick, meaning there are carriers who might not even know they're infected.
And unlike contact tracing for other types of diseases, Covid-19 is a respiratory illness. So contact tracers can't knock on people's doors the same way they might have done with other outbreaks, Harvey said.Does contact tracing actually help?""Without a doubt, contact tracing works,"" Harvey said.Some of the most successful countries in the fight against coronavirus have used widespread contact tracing. By quickly identifying contacts, those who might be infected were able to quarantine themselves and avoid spreading the virus to others.
""This is a strategy that goes hand-in-hand with economic recovery and reducing the isolation recommendations that are currently in place,"" Harvey said.
""Once people start coming out of their homes and returning to work and resuming aspects of a normal life, that's where this function is essential to measure outbreaks and warn people so we can intervene.""",1
"Yes, you can use soap and water on surfaces just like you would on your hands to kill coronavirus. But don’t use water alone — that won’t really help.The outer layer of the virus is made up of lipids, aka fat. Your goal is to break through that fatty barrier, forcing the virus’ guts to spill out and rendering it dead.
In other words, imagine coronavirus is a butter dish that you’re trying to clean.“You try to wash your butter dish with water alone, but that butter is not coming off the dish,” said Dr. John Williams, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.“You need some soap to dissolve grease. So soap or alcohol are very, very effective against dissolving that greasy liquid coating of the virus.”By cutting through the greasy barrier, Williams said, “it physically inactivates the virus so it can’t bind to and enter human cells anymore.”",1
"It’s too early to know for sure. But other coronaviruses, like ones that cause the common cold, might give us clues.With “common cold coronaviruses, you don’t actually have immunity that lasts for very long, and so we don’t know the answer with this specific coronavirus,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the New York University School of Medicine.“That’s actually going to be one of the challenges with designing a vaccine is how do you actually cause the immunity to last long enough to protect you.”",1
"Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood from patients who have recovered from an infection, the US Food and Drug Administration says. “Antibodies present in convalescent plasma are proteins that might help fight the infection.”But just like with normal blood donation, donors and recipients must be matched by blood type. Type AB plasma is the only universal type and can be given to patients of any blood type.The FDA said patients who are fully recovered from Covid-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma.The Red Cross said there are other requirements for plasma donors:You are at least 17 years old and weigh at least 110 pounds. (The age requirement may differ according to organization and state). Other weight requirements apply for donors age 18 or younger.You must be in good health overall health now.You cannot donate if you are pregnant or have certain conditions, such as HIV or sickle cell disease.",1
"Unlike SARS and swine flu, the novel coronavirus is both highly contagious and especially deadly, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.
“SARS was also a coronavirus, and it was a new virus at the time,” Gupta said. “In the end, we know that SARS ended up infecting 8,000 people around the world and causing around 800 deaths. So very high fatality rate, but it didn’t turn out to be very contagious.”The swine flu, or H1N1, “was very contagious and infected some 60 million people in the United States alone within a year,” Gupta said. “But it was far less lethal than the flu even — like 1/3 as lethal as the flu.”What makes the novel coronavirus different is that “this is both very contagious … and it appears to be far more lethal than the flu as well,” Gupta said. “So both those things, in combination I think, are why we’re taking this so seriously.”",1
"“That’s a bad idea,” said Dr. Colleen Kraft, an infectious diseases professor at Emory University School of Medicine. “It could definitely kill you.”President Donald Trump wondered aloud during a press conference whether there’s “a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning.”But the Reckitt Benckiser Group, which produces Lysol cleaning products, said “under no circumstance” should disinfectants be put into the human body.",1
"“I don’t think you need to,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.

Coronavirus can stay alive for up to three days on stainless steel and plastic. But clothing “is probably more like cardboard — it’s more absorbent, so the virus is unlikely to stay and last that long,” Gupta said.

While covonravirus can stay alive on cardboard for up to 24 hours, viruses generally don’t stick well on surfaces that are in motion.
“If you look at how viruses move through air, they kind of want to move around objects,” Gupta said. “They don’t want to necessarily land on objects. So if you’re moving as human body through the air … (it’s) unlikely to stick to your clothes.”",1
"“Viruses can live on surfaces and objects — including on money — although your chance of actually getting COVID-19 from cash is probably very low,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said.The new coronavirus can live for up to 72 hours on stainless steel and plastic, up to 24 hours after landing on cardboard, and up to four hours after landing on copper, according to a study funded by the US National Institutes of Health.So how do you protect yourself? Use contactless methods of payment whenever possible, Wen said.If you can’t use a contactless form of payment, credit cards and debit cards are much easier to clean and disinfect than cash. But remember that anyone who touches your credit card can also leave germs on it.If you must use cash, “wash your hands well with soap and water” afterward, Wen said. And since this is a respiratory virus, make sure you avoid touching your face.",1
"As the United States recorded its first coronavirus death -- and the number of infections grows worldwide -- many people are wondering what symptoms to be on the lookout for and how to protect themselves.There are now 71 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of coronavirus in the United States. Here's what you should know to keep yourself safe:What are the symptoms.Coronavirus makes people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold. Its symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache and a fever that can last for a couple of days.For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis.How does it spread.Transmission between humans happens when someone comes into contact with an infected person's secretions, such as droplets in a cough.Depending on how virulent the virus is, a cough, sneeze or handshake could cause exposure. The virus can also be transmitted by coming into contact with something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes. Caregivers can sometimes be exposed by handling a patient's waste, according to the CDC.The virus appears to mainly spread from person to person.""People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest),"" the CDC says. ""Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with ... coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.""
How is it treated.There is no specific antiviral treatment, but research is underway.Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own and experts advise seeking care early. If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see your doctor. Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing a pain or fever medication. The CDC says a room humidifier or a hot shower can help with a sore throat or cough.
People with coronavirus should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. In some severe cases, treatment includes care to support vital organ functions, the CDC says.People who think they may have been exposed to the virus should contact their healthcare provider immediately.How long is the incubation period.Quarantine is usually set up for the incubation period -- the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For coronavirus, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar illnesses.How can you can prevent it.There is no vaccine to protect against it, at least not yet.The US National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine but it will be months until clinical trials get underway and more than a year until it might become available.Meanwhile, you may be able to reduce your risk of infection by avoiding people who are sick. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch.Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.Awareness is also key. If you are sick and have reason to believe it may be coronavirus, you should let a health care provider know and seek treatment early.",1
"Earlier this month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its Covid-19 recommendations to specifically target older adults and people with serious underlying medical conditions. They labeled this group as ""higher risk.""However, another group of people could be particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 and hasn't received as much attention: people who smoke, vape or have substance use disorders.""[T]he research community should be alert to the possibility that [Covid-19] could hit some populations with substance use disorders particularly hard,"" Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse wrote in a blog post published last week.Because Covid-19 attacks the lungs, those who smoke tobacco or marijuana or who vape may be especially threatened, Volkow said.""When someone's lungs are exposed to flu or other infections the adverse effects of smoking or vaping are much more serious than among people who do not smoke or vape,"" Stanton Glantz, professor of medicine and director of the Center for Tobacco Research Control & Education at University of California, San Francisco, wrote in a blog post updated Tuesday.""Vaping affects your lungs at every level. It affects the immune function in your nasal cavity by affecting cilia which push foreign things out...[T]he ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,"" Glantz said in a phone interview.The CDC reported on Wednesday that young adults under age 44 make up a big part of Covid-19 hospitalizations in the US, and Glantz questions whether the vaping epidemic might have contributed to this.
""Some of my pulmonary [colleagues] have noted people under 30 [with Covid-19] ending up in hospitals and a couple were vapors,"" Glantz said. However, he said, there hasn't been enough research or evidence to support whether there's a link.People who smoke are generally at an increased risk of serious complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, when they have a severe infection.The odds of a Covid-19 case becoming more severe -- and at the most extreme, leading to death -- were 14 times higher among people who had a history of smoking compared to those who did not smoke, Glantz said, citing a study from China published in the peer-reviewed Chinese Medical Journal in February. The study also found those with a history of smoking had a 14% higher risk of developing pneumonia.
Concerns about other drugs, Besides smoking and e-cigarettes, Volkow wrote that people who abuse opioids and methamphetamine may be at risk for serious complications of Covid-19 because of the effects these drugs have on respiratory and pulmonary health.Opioids slow breathing and have already been shown to increase mortality in people with respiratory diseases, according to Volkow. ""[T]hus diminished lung capacity from COVID-19 could similarly endanger this population,"" she said.Methamphetamine has been shown to produce significant pulmonary damage since it binds heavily to pulmonary tissue, Volkow explained in a phone interview. This will likely increase the risk of negative outcomes if used during a Covid-19 infection.People with substance use disorders also rely on treatment that traditionally involves human interaction, such as therapy sessions or methadone clinics, which will be challenging in the setting of wide-spread social distancing, according to Dr. Allison Lin, assistant professor in psychiatry and the addiction center at the University of Michigan.
Lin said it's important for everyone to quit smoking due to its unknown -- but potentially serious -- effects on Covid-19 patients. This is particularly important for people with substance use disorders since they are more likely to smoke, she said.For everyone infected with Covid-19, one thing people can do now to reduce the risk of serious illness is quitting smoking, according to Glantz.""At a time when people are looking to reduce risk, it's very sensible to stop insulting your lungs,"" he said.",1
"Most coronavirus patients don’t need to be hospitalized. “The vast majority of people – about 80% – will do well without any specific intervention,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Those patients should get plenty of rest, hydrate frequently and take fever-reducing medication.“The current guidance – and this may change – is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them,” said Dr. Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association.But about 20% of coronavirus patients get advanced disease. “Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness,” the CDC says.The CDC also says you should get immediate help if you have:Trouble breathing.Persistent pain or pressure in the chest.Sudden confusion.Bluish lips or face.“This list is not all inclusive,” the CDC says. “Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.”",1
"Stay at least 6 feet away from others, wear a face covering when out in public, wash your hands often, and stop touching your face.The best way to kill germs is by scrubbing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Do this frequently before, during and after you visit a public place or have contact with people.When soap isn’t available, use a hand sanitizer. Rub the sanitizer around your hands until it’s dry.Stay home as much as possible and limit your contact with people.",1
"No. Those products work on surfaces but can be dangerous to your body.There are some chemical disinfectants, including bleach, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform, that may kill the virus on surfaces.But if the virus is already in your body, putting those substances on your skin or under your nose won’t kill it, the World Health Organization says. Not to mention, those chemicals can harm you.And please – do not ingest chemical disinfectants.",1
"While several drug trials are ongoing, there is currently no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID-19. The misuse of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness and even lead to death. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat COVID-19.",1
"“It takes anything up to six weeks to recover from this disease,” said Dr. Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization.
“People who suffer very severe illness can take months to recover from the illness.”Recovery is often marked by a patient no longer showing symptoms and having two consecutive negative tests at least one day apart, Ryan said. But there is no known cure for the novel coronavirus",1
"Although physicians still have no vaccine or cure for the novel coronavirus, health officials and pharmaceutical companies around the world are working hard to develop them.More than 20 potential vaccines aimed at preventing coronavirus disease are in development around the world, the World Health Organization's director-general said Friday.But health officials have consistently said it will take at least a year before any vaccine is proven effective and gets necessary approvals for wide distribution.Meanwhile, several treatments aimed at healing patients or alleviating symptoms already are in clinical trials.Here are some recent developments in the race for treatments and vaccines for the novel coronavirus.Potential treatments. The antiviral drug remdesivir:An existing antiviral drug, remdesivir, is showing signs of helping to treat this new coronavirus, the World Health Organization has said.""There is only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy and that's remdesivir,"" Bruce Aylward, a WHO assistant director-general, said this week at a press conference in Beijing.Remdesivir is an experimental drug that was tested in humans to treat the Ebola virus, though studies found it was ineffective for that.
Developed by American biotech firm Gilead Sciences, the drug is slated for these trials:The University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha: A clinical trial is underway there -- and the first participant is an American who was evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, the US National Institutes of Health said.Participants will receive 200 milligrams of remdesivir intravenously when they're enrolled and another 100 while they're hospitalized for up to 10 days in total. A placebo group will receive a solution that resembles remdesivir but contains only inactive ingredients, the NIH said.""We will know reasonably soon whether it works. And if it does, we will then have an effective therapy to distribute,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday.Studies elsewhere: About 1,000 coronavirus patients, primarily in Asia, will be part of two randomized studies of remdesivir, starting in March, Gilead Sciences said Wednesday.One will be for about 400 patients with severe symptoms. The other will be for about 600 patients with more moderate symptoms. The study will look at the effectiveness of different dosing durations: Patients in both groups will receive the drug for either five or 10 days.HIV drugs: Doctors around the world, including in Thailand and China, have been trying a combination of HIV and flu drugs.Results of those studies haven't been widely reported, but there are a few reasons to explore HIV antiretroviral drugs. Like HIV, coronaviruses are RNA viruses. And years ago, a combination of HIV drugs and an antiviral drug seemed to help some patients in the 2002-2004 outbreak of SARS, caused by a different coronavirus, according to a study published in the journal Thorax.""China learned from prior coronavirus epidemics (SARS and MERS) to repurpose antiretroviral and antiviral medications for partial treatment of this newest global health scare,"" Dr. Sten Vermund, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, wrote for CNN last month.Potential vaccines.A number of companies around the world say they've developed potential vaccines after obtaining genetic information about the virus.Since this coronavirus emerged in in December in Wuhan, China, these candidates have emerged quickly. By comparison, researchers took about 20 months to start human tests of the vaccine for SARS, Fauci has written.But the reality is that health officials insist these potential vaccines can't be approved for at least a year. Fauci gave CNN this outlook on Wednesday: The first Phase 1 clinical trial could begin in about two months. Such a trial, involving about 45 people, would last about three months. Researchers would try to determine if the candidate is safe and immunogenic.The next phase, involving hundreds of people, would last another six to eight months.So, even if a candidate is proven safe and effective, it won't be ready for use this year, Fauci said.Now, a look at some candidates: Moderna trial could start in April: US biotech firm Moderna has sent an experimental vaccine to the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and says its Phase 1 trial could start in April.Moderna, using messenger RNA, aims to make drugs that direct cells in the body to make proteins to prevent or fight disease.The technology has had positive results from Phase 1 tests across six different vaccines, one of which is currently in a Phase 2 trial, according to a company spokesperson. But Moderna has yet to produce a proven vaccine with its mRNA platform.Novavax and Inovio: US biotech firms Novavax and Inovio also say they have developed candidates. Novavax says it hopes its vaccine could start Phase 1 testing in May or June.Many other efforts: The US National Institutes of Health; Chinese biotech firm Clover, in a partnership with British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline; Israel's Institute for Biological Research; US pharma giant Johnson & Johnson; and Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases are among groups who've indicated they're working on a vaccine.",1
"To stop the spread of coronavirus, health officials have instructed the public to practice social distancing -- staying home, avoiding crowds and refraining from touching one another.Although living like that can be lonely, inconvenient and even frightening, it's for the greater good, says Danielle Ompad, an associate professor at New York University's School of Global Public Health.""It's uncomfortable,"" she told CNN. ""But it requires us to be good citizens. People have to learn how to think about the collective rather than the individual.""To help you do that, we answered your biggest questions about social distancing. Yes. The grocery store is one of the few public places you can still go -- just be strategic about it.Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, suggests going to the store when you suspect less people will be shopping. This could be late at night or early in the morning.Make sure to thoroughly wash fruits and veggies after you buy them, and wash your hands after touching boxes and before eating.Not sure what to buy? Here's a sample checklist of foods to stock up on so you won't make multiple trips.Can I order takeout?Sure can! There's no evidence that the virus can live in food, so whatever you eat should be safe.Still, it's a good idea to disinfect the takeout containers and wash your hands afterward, says Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent.Ordering takeout also helps restaurants and delivery drivers who may be losing money during the pandemic.Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center, suggests paying and tipping online and asking the delivery person to leave your food outside the door to avoid interaction.Should I use public transportation?If you can avoid it, you should. Packing into a crowded, poorly ventilated subway car or bus can heighten your risk of infection.
If you need to use public transportation to get to work, carry disinfecting wipes to clean seats and poles, and wash your hands as soon as your commute is over.
If I still need to work, how can I keep myself safe?Practice as much social distancing as your work allows. Wash your hands constantly, and if your occupation requires it, wear a face mask.Can I go anywhere?Yes, a few places -- grocery stores, doctor's offices and some outdoor areas. But right now, staying home as much as possible is the best way to lower infection rates, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Restaurants, places of worship, movie theaters, sports venues, museums and more have already started closing. Save a trip to these places until government and health officials say it's safe to visit.Travel.Can I still travel?Under most circumstances, you shouldn't.The US State Department issued a Level 4 ""Do Not Travel"" advisory, the most severe warning, urging Americans to cancel travel abroad.Airplanes, trains, buses and cruise ships can pack a lot of people in close quarters for long periods of time, which is a recipe for virus transmission.
""If you're going for vacation, I would suggest you don't go,"" says Ompad, the NYU professor. ""I definitely don't suggest you visit sick or elderly family. But some people don't have a choice -- they have to travel, work for airlines or trains or they're traveling because they're doing Covid-19 work or they can't afford to not do their jobs.""But the fewer of us who travel, the safer those essential workers will be, she says.If I'm traveling abroad, should I return to the US?Yes. The State Department has advised Americans living or traveling internationally to return to the US immediately. If Americans abroad do not return soon, they risk getting stuck in a foreign country for an indefinite period of time.Health.Should I wear a face mask in public?Probably not. Masks keep germs in by preventing sick people from coughing or sneezing into the air. But they don't protect healthy people from coming into contact with those germs.Sick people should stay home and avoid in-person contact with others until they've recovered. If available, sick people and those who live with them can wear masks at home, the CDC says.Can I exercise?Yes -- outdoors or at home. It's not a good idea to visit a gym, though.Distance is key. Going on a secluded run, walk or bike ride are fine ways to stay active outside -- just maintain at least six feet of distance from other people.At home, you can download exercise videos or apps and follow their instructions -- they're usually designed with minimal equipment in mind. Or you can follow these tips from CNN contributor Dr. Melinda Jampolis on how to work out at home.Can I go to the doctor or dentist?Not unless you have an urgent appointment or are seeking help due to coronavirus symptoms.It's best to cancel any appointments or elective procedures that aren't critical, says Dr. Carla Perissinotto, associate professor at the University of California-San Francisco's Department of Medicine.If you do have a critical appointment, ask your provider about telehealth appointments that don't require you to come into an office.If you think you're experiencing Covid-19 symptoms, call a physician before showing up at an office so you don't put yourself and others at a higher risk of infection.Family & Friends.Can I visit older family members?You shouldn't. Adults over 60 are at a higher risk of serious infection from Covid-19, and you could unwittingly infect them. The best thing older adults can do is stay home and away from others as much as possible.Keep in touch with them over the phone or with video calls. If they live nearby, offer to help them with groceries or medications they may need while home.Can my friends come over?They shouldn't. Visitors aren't a great idea right now, Ompad said, even if they are your friends.But distancing yourself doesn't mean you have to be lonely. Instead, host video hangouts with friends or call them regularly.Ompad talks with her colleagues and friends on Zoom, a video conference service. She and her pals cook together and chat about their days. It's a way to stay sane while staying home, even if all the interaction is virtual.""Social distancing does not mean social isolation. It's really important we maintain our social connections,"" Ompad says.Can I schedule playdates for my kids?No. Kids aren't considered a high-risk group for Covid-19, but they can still spread the virus.It's not yet clear how infectious they are, so it's best to keep children apart from each other and, if possible, out of your home.Plus, kids might not heed the six-feet distance or constant hand-washing rules.""We know that kids touch each other and rough house with each other, and so we really want to be mindful about reducing that interpersonal contact and any potential spread,"" says Dr. Asaf Bitton of Ariadne Labs, a health innovation center.Where can my kids play?Going outside is still okay -- just supervise your children to make sure they keep their distance from other kids, Ompad says.If you don't have a backyard, large parks where you can maintain a significant distance from other families should be fine. But avoid playgrounds, where germs can lurk on slides and swings, she says.Can I take my kids to daycare?If it's your only option, then yes. But before you do, call the daycare center or meet with staff to ensure they're implementing social distancing measures.If you urgently need child care, ask a healthy family member to watch your child and maintain proper distancing measures. If you work with a regular babysitter or nanny, use caution. They should be keeping themselves healthy on their own, but may be putting themselves at risk while commuting to work.Do I need to distance myself from my child?Probably not, Ompad says, unless either of you are showing symptoms of sickness.Under most circumstances, if you and your child are living in the same home, you don't need to keep six feet of distance. But if possible, limit excessive physical contact.If my family member or roommate works in health care, do I need to distance myself from them?Health care workers are at a higher risk of infection, so it's wise to distance yourself from them.Emory University epidemiologist Rachel Patzer tweeted that her husband, a physician who treats Covid-19 patients, moved into the garage to avoid infecting their young children.""It is difficult to see pictures of all the people at bars and restaurants, socializing, making play dates, and ignoring social distancing recommendations when I know my husband and many other healthcare workers are risking their lives to treat more sick patients,"" she wrote. 'Please, take this pandemic seriously.""
How long will we have to keep social distancing?Probably for several months. But we may have to do it over and over again, since the outbreak could come in waves.Research by the Imperial College in Great Britain ""would suggest you have to institute these kinds of measures for five months, very vigorously,"" says Gounder, the infectious disease specialist.""And then you may be able to relax for a period. And then you would re-institute as the cases go up again. But we're basically looking at doing this over and over and over again, even after a five-month period of strict social distancing, in order to curb cases until we have a vaccine.""",1
"The novel coronavirus can infect anyone, but it's older adults — ages 60 and up — who are more likely to get seriously sick from it.Some tips are applicable to every generation, but there are specific precautions older adults should take to protect their health.We spoke to two geriatricians and pulled guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assemble what people 60 and up need to know about the novel coronavirus.You can download a sheet of that information (in English, Spanish and Chinese) and share with your loved ones. But remember: Recommendations for Covid-19 may change as officials learn more, so monitor your local health department and the CDC for updates.What's your risk level. The CDC says ""older adults"" and people with severe chronic illness are more likely to become severely ill from Covid-19.Infectious disease experts define ""older adults"" as anyone age 60 and up, so people in that age group should be cautious.It's possible to contract the virus at a younger age — it's just more dangerous in older adults because the immune system weakens with age, said Dr. Samir Sinha, director of Geriatrics for the Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto.People over the age of 80 may want to exercise even more caution. A report published in the medical journal JAMA that examined more than 72,000 Chinese coronavirus patients found that the overall fatality rate was 2.3%. But in adults over 80, the fatality rate rose to 15%.If you live in a community where there's an outbreak, you're at a higher risk of infection, too. Follow the advice below.What precautions you should take now.Cancel all non-essential doctor's appointments, said Dr. Carla Perissinotto, an associate professor in the Geriatrics Division of the University of California-San Francisco's Department of Medicine.Whether it's a standard check-up, a follow-up appointment for a stable condition or an elective procedure, if it can wait, then it should.If you have an important appointment coming up, consider doing it in a video call or from your smartphone. Telehealth tech lets physicians confer with patients who may not be able to leave their homes.Tell a friend, a loved one, a co-worker or a neighbor if you're concerned about the illness. Appoint one of them as an emergency contact who you can call with concerns or requests for help.Otherwise, do what you'd do during flu season: Wash your hands frequently, the right way (get ready to read that a lot). Use hand sanitizer when soap and water aren't available, though washing your hands is preferred.What you should stock up on.The CDC recommends keeping enough groceries and toiletries on hand to last you a ""prolonged period of time."" There's no timeline for the Covid-19 outbreak, though, so think basic.Stock up on toothpaste, detergent, water filters, etc. Make meals and freeze them if you're concerned about food.But stocking up on medication ahead of time isn't always plausible, Perissinotto said. You may be able to switch to a 90-day supply for your prescription. If this isn't possible, the CDC suggests mail ordering medications.How you should alter daily activities.Older adults living in communities where the virus has spread should take extra precautions.Avoid public places where crowds may gather or poorly ventilated buildings where the risk of transmission is higher, the CDC said.Restrict your time in public and limit close contact.Older adults should still exercise and eat right, just as they would at any other time of the year, Sinha said.And again, constant — and proper — handwashing before, during and after a trip into the public is necessary.How you should handle travel.The CDC advises against non-essential plane travel for older adults. Several US airlines have already slashed their flight schedules for the next few months.It's wise to stay off cruise ships for now, too. Cruise passengers are at an increased risk of person-to-person transmission with all the tight quarters, the CDC said, so if you're already made cruise plans, it's best to cancel them.What you need to know about self-isolation. The CDC recommends that high-risk groups in communities with outbreaks stay home as much as possible and that people who believe they're sick isolate themselves.Isolation can be damaging, too, if you cut off contact and are lonely.""I don't think the solution of totally being devoid of social contact is the answer,"" Perissinotto said. ""Yes, there is some prudence we need to have in social distancing, but we also have to be careful to not isolate more -- it can be very detrimental.""So if you're self-isolating:Don't cut off contact with family or friends.Keep in touch to update them on your condition and curb boredom.And if you do go out, be sure to wash your hands with soap.What your family can do.To help you, your family should think ahead.Perissinotto recommends that family, friends and neighbors of older adults do some inventory in case the older adult needs to isolate at home.Does this person have what they need to spend an extended period of time inside? If not, help them prepare supplies.If their caregiver calls in sick, is there someone who can step in to take care of them? Have a plan in place to make sure they'll get care if they need it.If they have a telemedicine appointment coming up, will they know how to access it? Set up the tech and show them how to use it to speak with their physician.Getting prepared and keeping in touch can help keep families connected if an older member needs to isolate, Perissinotto said.And, of course, sick family members should not visit — stick to a phone or video call. And if a younger, healthy family member has potentially come into contact with a Covid-19 patient, they should self-isolate and avoid seeing older, susceptible family members.What you should consider about nursing homes. It's natural to be fearful for family in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, Sinha said: Older people and people with chronic illnesses, both high-risk groups, are living together in tight quarters.The good news: Most nursing homes and long-term care facilities are prepared for pandemics, Perissonotto said.The CDC provides training for long-term care facilities on how to operate during pandemics. If you're concerned about the safety of your family member or want to learn about the protocol their facility is following, contact staff at the facility.What you should do when visiting loved ones at nursing homes.Under the national emergency declaration, nursing home visits are now restricted with limited exceptions. The new federal guidance also cancels communal meals and group activities.Set up an alternative mode of communication between residents and family to keep up with their health and wellbeing.What to do if you're sick. If you think you have the novel coronavirus: Stay home and call your physician. If they think you should come in for a test, limit your interaction with other people and don't use public transportation. They may provide a face mask for you to wear while in their office.If your doctor is not immediately available: Consider calling a local coronavirus hotline. Some city, county and state health departments have numbers you can call to discuss your symptoms and learn more about the virus's impact on the community. Keep in mind that these hotlines are meant as informational resources, and it's impossible to diagnose Covid-19 without a test.If you're diagnosed with the novel coronavirus and your illness is mild: Your physician may advise that you stay home until you recover. If your symptoms are more severe, you may be hospitalized so physicians can monitor your condition.",1
"Please consider the risk. We talked to Dr. Samir Sinha. He's the director of Geriatrics for the Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto. And this is what he says:Until there's a vaccine, the most vulnerable people should continue to stay home if they can. That includes grandparents over 60 like you and people with chronic illnesses.You see, people in those categories are more likely to become severely ill if they contract coronavirus. We don't want that to be you.""I think the pandemic has been really hard for everybody, but social isolation is a particular issue for older adults,"" he says. ""One of the greatest joys for older people is seeing younger people in their lives and having intergenerational connections.""It's a tricky balance, we know.On one hand, meaningful connections are hugely important -- they can enrich and even prolong your life. But seeing a loved one means you'll interact with people you haven't seen in weeks who've spent their isolation in a different environment than you. You have to decide whether that risk is worth it to you.Let's talk about it.Maybe you think we, your loving family members, have banned you from visiting.""There is this tension between families where older people feel their families are being overprotective of them or infringing on their rights,"" Sinha says.It doesn't have to be a stalemate. Let's talk it out.""It should be a shared choice,"" Sinha says. ""That person hears why their loved one actually wants to protect them, and this prompts a conversation and helps the person understand, 'While I'm worried about you getting Covid-19, I appreciate that you want to protect me from that.'""Discuss why you want to visit and acknowledge the risk involved.Have you been staying home and limiting your exposures?Or have you had to work daily in environments that could expose them to the virus.If it's the second one, it's best to visit virtually.Follow the safest protocol.There's no way to ensure total safety. But there are steps we all can take to keep the risk as low as possible.Read over Sinha's recommendations, which he developed with the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council:Be well. Make sure you're not sick when you plan to visit, whether that means a runny nose, fever or stomach ache -- any form of illness. We won't let you visit if any of us are sick, either.Wear masks. Keep it on for the duration of your visit, if you can. If you're asymptomatic, masks help keep you from breathing out the virus. (And you can learn how to make your own.)Wash your hands. As soon as you walk in, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. As your family, we'll disinfect frequently touched surfaces before you arrive.Greet without touch. Try not to greet us with a kiss or hug, as hard as that may be to resist.Keep your distance. You know the drill: Keep at least six feet of distance. We know, it's weird.Sinha also recommends his older patients re-up their vaccinations, particularly against the flu and pneumonia.If you do come down with coronavirus, there's a higher chance you may also become infected with pneumonia or the flu at the same time. Multiple illnesses will stress out your immune system. Pace yourself when you're visiting. So, it's decided -- you're visiting. Now you may need to pick which family members get first dibs on you.When you visit multiple people, the possibility that you'll be exposed to the virus grows, Dr. William Schaffner told us. He's an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.""Start off with a few people, or just one at a time,"" Schaffner says. ""This is not the time to have a once-in-20-years family reunion.""Here's another consideration that may sway your choice: Children younger than 5 may have trouble adhering to social distancing measures. If they (or you) can't resist bear hugs or slobbery cheek kisses, consider visiting families with older children, Sinha says. Let's meet outside.Schaffner suggests we choose the great outdoors as our reunion venue, like a park or garden where we can stay safely distant from others.Transmission is unlikely outside, as long as we're keeping 6 feet apart, thanks to constant air flow, Schaffner says. But it's best to wear a mask anyway to prevent asymptomatic transmission should we accidentally come close.One last thing: We, your doting relatives, love you dearly. These guidelines aren't ideal, and we've never had to do anything like this before. But if we take these measures now, we'll do our part to stop the spread of coronavirus. And when this pandemic is through, we can bring on the bear hugs again.Oh, and keep washing your hands.",1
"By now, you've likely heard the main pieces of advice to avoid the coronavirus.Wear a mask. Wash your hands with soap. Stay at least 6 feet from others. If you do gather with others, go outside rather than inside.Still, there's one more aspect to infection that has received less attention. Growing evidence suggests that Covid-19 infection, like with other illnesses, is related to prolonged time exposed to the virus. The longer you stay in an environment that may contain the virus, the higher the risk of getting sick.Erin Bromage, a comparative immunologist and professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, summed it up with a short and sweet equation: ""Successful Infection = Exposure to Virus x Time.""Bromage's simplified formula was part of a recent blog post explaining ways to lower your risk of catching Covid-19 that has been read over 15 million times in the past two weeks, he told CNN.The main idea is that people get infected when they are exposed to a certain amount of viral particles. That viral threshold can be reached by an infected person's sneeze or cough, which releases a large number of viral particles into the air. But an infected person talking or even just breathing still releases some virus into the air, and over a long period of time in an enclosed space, that could still infect others.""The longer time you spend in that environment -- so minutes or hours in there -- the more virus you breathe in, the more it can build up and then establish infection,"" Bromage said. ""So it's always a balance of exposure and time. If you get a high level of exposure, it's a short time (to infection, and if you get a) low level of exposure, it's a longer time before that infection can establish.""The importance of time exposed to a virus is relevant for all infectious diseases, from measles to tuberculosis to Covid-19, said Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.Indeed, it's the underlying theory behind contact tracing, which tries to locate and contact anyone who has spent prolonged time near an infected person.Bromage said his simple formula suggests that a short shopping trip comes with a comparatively low risk of infection -- but employees in those same stores for eight-hour shifts have a higher risk.""Even if there is virus in that environment, you hopefully haven't had that extended time needed to get to that infectious dose. The employees, though, are in that environment all day,"" he said. ""So what wouldn't infect you and I because it didn't get to that infectious dose number, has a much stronger effect or larger effect on an employee that gets that low dose all day.""Gym class, restaurant and choir practice as examples.Several case studies of Covid-19 outbreaks over the past few months show the dangers of spending a long time in an enclosed space with an infected person, including at a choir practice in Washington state, a restaurant in China and a fitness studio in South Korea.In Washington state, a single infected person attended a two-and-a-half hour choir practice on March 10, according to a report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the 61 attendees, 53 people, or 87% of the group, developed Covid-19 afterward, the report said.No one reported physical contact between the attendees at the practices, but they sat close together. The report said the chairs were 6-10 inches apart, but there were empty seats between some of the members. The choir broke into two groups for part of the practice, and members moved closer together for that 45-minute session, they said.Another example of the dangers of prolonged exposure came at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, on January 24. Over lunch that lasted about an hour, an infected person spread the virus to four people at their table, two people at a nearby table and three people at another nearby table.
The study concluded that the transmission of the virus was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation at the restaurant and recommended restaurants increase the distance between tables as well as improve their ventilation.Finally, researchers in South Korea linked more than 100 coronavirus infections to a four-hour fitness instructor workshop from mid-February, according to research published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal from the CDC.Almost 30 instructors participated in the original workshop, which was held in Cheonan, South Korea. They trained intensely for four hours, and while none had symptoms at the time, eight instructors eventually tested positive for the virus.Less than a month later, researchers had identified 112 coronavirus cases linked to dance classes in a dozen different facilities. Half of the cases were the result of direct transmission from instructors to students, and some people went on to infect others outside of class.The classes linked to transmission had between five to 22 students and took place in small spaces for almost an hour. Out of 217 students exposed to infected instructors, 57 of them, or about one in four, ended up testing positive.How long is too long?Because experimenting with viruses on humans is unethical, data is limited on exactly how much exposure and time are needed for an infection. The number also varies by person, as older or immuno-compromised people have lower thresholds to infection.""Data are insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website. ""Recommendations vary on the length of time of exposure but 15 min of close exposure can be used as an operational definition.""Sepkowitz similarly said that shorter exposure times are safer, but there is no hard and fast rule for how long is too long.""Everyone has a little bit of risk per minute, and it's a cumulative thing,"" he said.The other part of Bromage's equation -- the issue of ""exposure to virus"" -- also varies depending on the actions within that enclosed space. For example, he said that louder places are riskier because infected people emit more virus when they talk loudly or when they sing, such as in the chorus case study in Washington.
Quieter places with fewer airborne particles may also be lower risk. In the South Korea fitness case study, one of the infected instructors taught Pilates and yoga, and none of her students contracted the virus.""We hypothesize that the lower intensity of Pilates and yoga did not cause the same transmission effects as those of the more intense fitness dance classes,"" the researchers said.",1
"Scientists are increasingly optimistic that a vaccine can be produced in record time. But getting it manufactured and distributed will pose huge challenges.In a medical research project nearly unrivaled in its ambition and scope, volunteers worldwide are rolling up their sleeves to receive experimental vaccines against the coronavirus — only months after the virus was identified.Companies like Inovio and Pfizer have begun early tests of candidates in people to determine whether their vaccines are safe. Researchers at the University of Oxford in England are testing vaccines in human subjects, too, and say they could have one ready for emergency use as soon as September.Moderna on Monday announced encouraging results of a safety trial of its vaccine in eight volunteers. There were no published data, but the news alone sent hopes soaring.Animal studies have raised expectations, too. Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center on Wednesday published research showing that a prototype vaccine effectively protected monkeys from infection with the virus.The findings will pave the way to development of a human vaccine, said the investigators. They have already partnered with Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson.In labs around the world, there is now cautious optimism that a coronavirus vaccine, and perhaps more than one, will be ready sometime next year.Scientists are exploring not just one approach to creating the vaccine, but at least four. So great is the urgency that they are combining trial phases and shortening a process that usually takes years, sometimes more than a decade.The coronavirus itself has turned out to be clumsy prey, a stable pathogen unlikely to mutate significantly and dodge a vaccine.“It’s an easier target, which is terrific news,” said Michael Farzan, a virologist at Scripps Research in Jupiter, Fla.An effective vaccine will be crucial to ending the pandemic, which has sickened at least 4.7 million worldwide and killed at least 324,000. Widespread immunity would reopen the door to lives without social distancing and face masks.“What people don’t realize is that normally vaccine development takes many years, sometimes decades,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who led the monkey trials. “And so trying to compress the whole vaccine process into 12 to 18 months is really unheard-of.”“If that happens, it will be the fastest vaccine development program ever in history.”More than 100 research teams around the world are taking aim at the virus from multiple angles.Moderna’s vaccine is based on a relatively new mRNA technology that delivers bits of the virus’s genes into human cells. The goal is for cells to begin making a viral protein that the immune system recognizes as foreign. The body builds defenses against that protein, priming itself to attack if the actual coronavirus invades.Some vaccine makers, including Inovio, are developing vaccines based on DNA variations of this approach.But the technology used by both companies has never produced a vaccine approved for clinical use, let alone one that can be made in industrial quantities. Moderna was criticized for making rosy predictions, based on a handful of patients, without providing any scientific data.Other research teams have turned to more traditional strategies.Some scientists are using harmless viruses to deliver coronavirus genes into cells, forcing them to produce proteins that may teach the immune system to watch out for the coronavirus. CanSino Biologics, a company in China, has begun human testing of a coronavirus vaccine that relies on this approach, as has the University of Oxford team.Other traditional approaches rely on fragments of a coronavirus protein to make a vaccine, while some use killed, or inactivated, versions of the whole coronavirus. In China, such vaccines have already entered human trials.Florian Krammer, a virologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, predicted that at least 20 additional vaccine candidates will make their way into clinical trials in the weeks to come.“I’m not worried at all about it,” he said of the prospects for a new vaccine.Many of these vaccines will stumble as the trials progress. As more people are inoculated, some candidates will fail to protect against the virus, and side effects will become more apparent.But from what scientists are learning about the coronavirus, it ought to be a relatively easy target.The coronavirus sports tempting targets on its surface, unique “spike” proteins the pathogen needs to enter human cells. The immune system readily learns to recognize these proteins, it appears, and to attack them, killing the virus.Viruses can challenge vaccine makers by mutating rapidly, changing shape so that antibodies that work on one viral strain fail on another. Thankfully, the new coronavirus seems to be a slow mutator, and a vaccine that proves effective in trials should work anywhere in the world.When work on a coronavirus vaccine started, some researchers worried that antibodies actually might worsen Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. But in early studies, no serious risks have emerged.“That doesn’t mean that there won’t be, but so far there hasn’t been any indication, so I’m cautiously optimistic on that point,” said Dr. Alyson Kelvin, a researcher at the Canadian Center for Vaccinology and Dalhousie University.Scaling Up.Ensuring that vaccines are safe and effective demands large trials that require careful planning and execution. If successful vaccines emerge from those trials, someone’s going to have to make an awful lot of them.Almost everyone on the planet is vulnerable to the new coronavirus. Each person may need two doses of a new vaccine to receive protective immunity. That’s 16 billion doses.“When companies promise of delivering a vaccine in a year or less, I am not sure what stage they are talking about,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunobiologist at Yale University. “I doubt they are talking about global distributions in billions of doses.”Manufacturing vaccines is profoundly more complex than manufacturing, say, shoes or bicycles. Vaccines typically require large vats in which their ingredients are grown, and these have to be maintained in sterile conditions. Also, no factories have ever churned out millions of doses of approved vaccines made with the cutting-edge technology being tested by companies like Inovio and Moderna.Facilities have sprung up in recent years to make viral-vector vaccines, including a Johnson & Johnson plant in the Netherlands. But meeting pandemic demand would be an enormous challenge. Manufacturers have the most experience mass-producing inactivated vaccines, made with killed viruses, so this type may be the easiest to produce in large quantities.But there cannot be just one vaccine. If that were to happen, the company that made it would have no chance of meeting the world’s demand.“The hope is that they will all, at some level, be effective, and certainly that’s important because we need more than just one,” said Emilio Emini, a director of the vaccine program at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is providing financial support to many competing vaccine efforts.As part of a public-private partnership the White House calls Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration has promised to design a kind of parallel manufacturing track to run alongside the clinical trials, building up capacity well before trials are concluded, in hopes that one or more vaccines could be distributed immediately upon approval.President Trump said on Friday that the goal of the project was to distribute a vaccine “prior to the end of the year.” To do that, Mr. Trump is relying on the Defense Department to manage the manufacturing logistics related to vaccine development.But in an interview on Thursday, Gen. Gustave F. Perna, who will manage the manufacturing logistics, said discussions about the equipment and facilities needed for production were just beginning.He described his work as a “math problem”: how to get 300 million doses of a vaccine that doesn’t yet exist to Americans — by January.Finding the supplies and planning their distribution would occur at the same time, he said. “I need to have syringes,” General Perna said. “I need to have wipes, right? I need to have Band-Aids. I need to have the vaccine.”He added: “Now, how am I going to distribute it? What is it going to be distributed in? What do I need to order now to make sure I have the distribution capability? The small bottles, the trucks.”Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said that seemingly minor aspects of production and distribution could complicate progress later on.“This is on a scale we’ve never seen since the polio vaccine,” he said. “It’s the little things like the syringes, the needles, the glass vials. All of that has to be thought about. You don’t want something that seems so simple to be the bottleneck in your vaccination program.”A coronavirus vaccine doesn’t yet exist, but already there are questions about who will be able to afford it.At the World Health Assembly meeting this week, a proposal from the European Union was adopted recommending a voluntary patent pool, which would put pressure on companies to give up their monopolies on vaccines they’ve developed.Oxfam, an international charity, has published an open letter from 140 world leaders and experts calling for a “people’s vaccine,” which would be “made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge.”“These vaccines have to be a public good,” said Helen Clark, a former prime minister of New Zealand, who signed the letter. “We’re not safe till everyone is safe.”",1
"The Coronavirus Genome.The coronavirus is an oily membrane packed with genetic instructions to make millions of copies of itself. The instructions are encoded in 30,000 “letters” of RNA — a, c, g and u — which the infected cell reads and translates into many kinds of virus proteins.A New Coronavirus.In December, a cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases appeared around a seafood market in Wuhan, China. In early January, researchers sequenced the first genome of a new coronavirus, which they isolated from a man who worked at the market. That first genome became the baseline for scientists to track the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it spreads around the world.A Typo in the RNA. A cell infected by a coronavirus releases millions of new viruses, all carrying copies of the original genome. As the cell copies that genome, it sometimes makes mistakes, usually just a single wrong letter. These typos are called mutations. As coronaviruses spread from person to person, they randomly accumulate more mutations.The genome below came from another early patient in Wuhan and was identical to the first case, except for one mutation. The 186th letter of RNA was u instead of c.When researchers compared several genomes from the Wuhan cluster of cases they found only a few new mutations, suggesting that the different genomes descended from a recent common ancestor. Viruses accumulate new mutations at a roughly regular rate, so the scientists were able to estimate that the origin of the outbreak was in China sometime around November 2019.One Descendent, Two More Mutations.Outside of Wuhan, that same mutation in the 186th letter of RNA has been found in only one other sample, which was collected seven weeks later and 600 miles south in Guangzhou, China. The Guangzhou sample might be a direct descendent of the first Wuhan sample. Or they might be viral cousins, sharing a common ancestor.During those seven weeks, the Guangzhou lineage jumped from person to person and went through several generations of new viruses. And along the way, it developed two new mutations: Two more letters of RNA changed to u.When Do Mutations Matter?Mutations will often change a gene without changing the protein it encodes.Proteins are long chains of amino acids folded into different shapes. Each amino acid is encoded by three genetic letters, but in many cases a mutation to the third letter of a trio will still encode the same amino acid. These so-called “silent mutations” don’t change the resulting protein.“Non-silent” mutations do change a protein’s sequence, and the Guangzhou sample of the coronavirus acquired two non-silent mutations.But proteins can be made of hundreds or thousands of amino acids. Changing a single amino acid often has no noticeable effect on their shape or how they work.Some Mutations Disappear, Others Spread.As the months have passed, parts of the coronavirus genome have gained many mutations. Others have gained few, or none at all. This striking variation may hold important clues to coronavirus biology.The parts of the genome that have accumulated many mutations are more flexible. They can tolerate changes to their genetic sequence without causing harm to the virus. The parts with few mutations are more brittle. Mutations in those parts may destroy the coronavirus by causing catastrophic changes to its proteins. Those essential regions may be especially good targets for attacking the virus with antiviral drugs.As mutations accumulate in coronavirus genomes, they allow scientists to track the spread of Covid-19 around the world.The First American Case. On January 15, a man flew home to the Seattle area after visiting family in Wuhan. After a few days of mild symptoms he tested positive for Covid-19. He became the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in the United States.The genome of his virus contained three single-letter mutations also found in viruses in China. They allowed scientists to trace the man’s infection to its source.Seattle’s Hidden Epidemic.Five weeks later, a high school student in Snohomish County, Wash., developed flu-like symptoms. A nose swab revealed he had Covid-19. Scientists sequenced the genome of his coronavirus sample and found it shared the same distinctive mutations found in the first case in Washington, but also bore three additional mutations.That combination of old and new mutations suggested that the student did not acquire the coronavirus from someone who had recently arrived from another country. Instead, the coronavirus was probably circulating undetected in the Seattle area for about five weeks, since mid-January.Since then, viruses with a genetic link to the Washington cluster have now appeared in at least 14 states and several countries around the world, as well as nine cases on the Grand Princess cruise ship.Early Transmission in California. A different version of the coronavirus was also secretly circulating in California. On Feb. 26, the C.D.C. announced that a patient in Solano County with no known ties to any previous case or overseas travel had tested positive.A sample taken the next day revealed that the virus did not have the distinctive mutations found in Washington State. Instead, it only had a single mutation distinguishing it from the original Wuhan genome. That indicates that it got to California through a separate introduction from China.Two healthcare workers who cared for the patient also became sick. Along with the patient’s mutation, their sample had additional mutations.A Torrent of Viruses In January and February, more people arrived in the United States carrying coronaviruses of their own. Some viruses carried mutations indicating they had arrived from China or other parts of Asia. But in New York City, the majority of viruses researchers isolated from patients were genetic matches to viruses that had been circulating in Europe.Shanghai to Munich.On Jan. 19 — the same day the first Washington patient tested positive for Covid-19 — a woman from Shanghai landed in Munich. Not long before the trip, her parents from Wuhan had paid her a visit. By the time she got to Munich she felt only mild symptoms, which she put down as jet lag.The woman was employed by a German auto parts supplier. The day after she arrived, she went to a company meeting. Several other employees at the meeting got sick and tested positive for Covid-19. The coronavirus genome from a German man at the meeting had mutations linking it back to China.Genetically similar versions of the virus later spread into other parts of Europe, but it’s unclear if they came from this cluster of cases or from a different introduction.
Welcome to New York March 1.The first confirmed case of Covid-19 in New York was announced on March 1, after a woman living in Manhattan was infected while visiting Iran. Of all the viruses that scientists have studied in New York since then, none bears the mutations in her coronavirus genome. That indicates that her infection was not part of a continuing chain of transmissions.Instead, most of the New York coronaviruses that scientists have sequenced show genetic links to coronaviruses in Europe. Others came from Asia, and still others may have come from other parts of the United States.Reintroductions and Deportations March and April.Soon, the United States and Europe became new sources for introductions to other countries. Dozens of Guatemalans sent on deportation flights from the U.S. later tested positive for the virus, and coronaviruses carrying mutations that arose in Europe have been reintroduced to Asia.A Slow-Mutating Virus
At this point in the pandemic, coronavirus genomes with 10 or fewer mutations are common, and only a small number have over 20 mutations — which is still less than a tenth of a percent of the genome.Over time, viruses can evolve into new strains — in other words, viral lineages that are significantly different from each other. Since January, researchers have sequenced many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and tracked all the mutations that have arisen. So far, they haven’t found compelling evidence that the mutations have had a significant change in how the virus affects us.In fact, researchers have found that the coronavirus is mutating relatively slowly compared to some other RNA viruses, in part because virus proteins acting as proofreaders are able to fix some mistakes. Each month, a lineage of coronaviruses might acquire only two single-letter mutations.In the future, the coronavirus may pick up some mutations that help it evade our immune systems. But the slow mutation rate of the coronavirus means that these changes will emerge over the course of years.That bodes well for vaccines currently in development for Covid-19. If people get vaccinated in 2021 against the new coronavirus, they may well enjoy a protection that lasts for years.What We Don’t Know.Researchers have only sequenced a tiny fraction of the coronaviruses that now infect over three million people worldwide.Sequencing more genomes will uncover more chapters in the virus’s history, and scientists are particularly eager to study mutations from regions where few genomes have been sequenced, such as Africa and South America.",1
"Although scientists and stock markets have celebrated the approval for emergency use of remdesivir to treat COVID-19, a cure for the disease that has killed over 304,000 people remains a long way off — and might never arrive.Hundreds of drugs are being studied around the world, but “I don’t see a lot of home runs right now,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, a professor of infectious diseases at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health. “I see a lot of strikeouts.”Researchers have launched more than 1,250 studies of COVID-19. Pharmaceutical companies are investing billions to develop effective drugs and vaccines to help end the pandemic.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was cautious when announcing the results of a clinical trial of remdesivir last week, noting it isn’t a “knockout.” Although remdesivir helped hospitalized COVID-19 patients recover more quickly, it hasn’t been proved to save lives.“This [drug] is opening the door,” Fauci said. “As more companies and investors get involved, it’s going to get better and better.”Researchers have already announced that they will combine remdesivir with an anti-inflammatory drug, baricitinib — now used to treat rheumatoid arthritis — in the hope of improving results.But COVID-19 is an elusive enemy.Doctors treating COVID patients say they’re fighting a war on multiple fronts, battling a virus that batters organs throughout the body, causes killer blood clots and prompts an immune system overreaction called a “cytokine storm.”With so many parts of the body under siege at once, scientists say, improving survival rates will require multiple routes of attack — and more than one drug. While some of the experimental medications target the virus, others aim to prevent the immune system from inflicting collateral damage.“There are so many pieces of this, and they will all require different therapies,” said Dr. Lewis Kaplan, president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, whose doctors provide intensive care.High-tech approaches include using stem cells, virus-specific T cells and synthetic antibodies to neutralize the coronavirus.Scientists are also taking a fresh look at existing medications that might be repurposed to fight COVID-19. These include antivirals for influenza, arthritis drugs, estrogen patches and even antacids. If repurposed drugs are successful, they could reach patients relatively quickly, because doctors are already familiar with their side effects and safety concerns.Some doctors are skeptical that drugs for heartburn or hot flashes have any chance of treating a killer like COVID-19.Dr. Steven Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, said he fears that hype over unproven products will harm patients, even if it temporarily boosts company stock prices. Patients who demand antacids or antimalarial drugs being studied in COVID-19 could be harmed by side effects, for example. Those who hoard drugs — on the hope of protecting themselves from COVID-19 — could deprive other patients of medications they need to stay healthy. Some people may refuse to participate in clinical trials because they fear being given a placebo.“This rush to get every imaginable treatment into a study, it’s not prudent,” Nissen said. “It’s not good medicine. It’s an act of desperation.”Other experts say scientists should cast a wide net.“I don’t think we want to rule anything out because it sounds out of the ordinary,” said Dr. Walid Gellad, director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh.Antivirals In The Spotlight. Antivirals such as remdesivir aim to prevent viruses from replicating, said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.That doesn’t always work. A small Chinese study of remdesivir, published last month in The Lancet, found no benefit to severely ill COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir had previously failed when tested against Ebola.Antivirals tend to be most helpful in the early stages of infection, when most of the harm to the patient is caused by the virus itself, rather than the immune system, Hotez said.Remdesivir is just one of many antivirals being tested against COVID-19.International researchers are studying the antiviral favipiravir, developed to fight the flu.The antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine — which have been heavily touted by President Donald Trump — also have antiviral effects. Although the Food and Drug Administration approved forms of those drugs for emergency use against COVID-19, the agency later warned that they could cause dangerous heart rhythm problems.A study in the New England Journal of Medicine likewise found no benefit in giving two antivirals used to treat HIV ―a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, sold as Kaletra— in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19.Harnessing The Immune System.One of the therapies generating excitement is also one of the oldest: antibody-rich blood from COVID survivors.The immune system produces antibodies in response to invaders such as viruses and bacteria, allowing the body to recognize and neutralize them. Antibodies also recognize and neutralize the virus the next time that person is exposed.Doctors hope that patients who develop antibodies against the novel coronavirus will become immune, at least for a few years, although this hasn’t been proved.Scientists developing this “convalescent plasma” are studying whether COVID-19 survivors can share this immunity with others by donating their plasma, the liquid part of blood that contains antibodies, said Dr. Shmuel Shoham, an associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
In addition to treating people who are already sick, donated plasma could potentially prevent people exposed to the virus — such as health care workers — from developing symptoms.Donated antibodies ― and any immunity they might provide — don’t last forever, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The body destroys aging antibodies as part of its routine maintenance, he said. In general, half of donated antibodies are eliminated in about three weeks.
The use of convalescent plasma goes back more than a century. It was used during the 1918 flu pandemic and was shown to improve survival during the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic.Doctors don’t know yet whether convalescent plasma will benefit people with COVID-19.In general, convalescent plasma is expected to be more effective in preventing illness than in treating it. It may be less likely to help someone in intensive care, Shoham said.Researchers are also studying the use of prepackaged plasma, called intravenous immunoglobulin, in COVID patients. This product, known as IVIG, is taken from healthy donors in the general population and has long been used to help patients with weakened immune systems fight off infections. Hospitals keep it in stock and some are already using it to treat COVID patients.Although the antibodies in prepackaged IVIG don’t specifically target the coronavirus, researchers hope they will tamp down the immune response.In a third form of immune therapy, researchers are trying to identify the specific antibodies that are most important for neutralizing the coronavirus, then reproduce them as drugs called monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are already used to treat a variety of conditions, from cancer to rheumatoid arthritis and migraines.“When we give people an antibody, they are immediately at least partially immune to that specific virus,” said Dr. James Crowe, director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center, who hopes to have antibodies ready for a clinical trial in a few months. “We’re moving the immune system from one person to another.”Ideally, doctors would develop a very potent monoclonal antibody or a cocktail of antibodies for COVID-19 patients, to ensure the best chance of success, Crowe said. But manufacturing these drugs can be complicated, expensive and time-consuming.“Making two antibodies would be at least twice as complicated as making one,” Crowe said. “A cocktail might be preferred, but cocktails are harder to move quickly.”Calming The Immune System.In most cases of COVID-19, the immune system neutralizes the coronavirus and patients recover without going to the hospital.For reasons that doctors don’t totally understand, the immune system of some COVID-19 patients becomes hyperactive, attacking not just the virus but the patient’s own cells. A “cytokine storm,” in which the immune system floods the body with inflammatory chemicals, can do more damage than the virus itself.
In an effort to calm the immune system, researchers are testing immune-suppressing drugs, including monoclonal antibodies already used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.Health care giant Roche is conducting large clinical trials of its drug, Actemra, in the hope of preventing cytokine storms, which can cause organ failure and a life-threatening condition called sepsis. Actemra is designed to lower levels of an inflammatory chemical, interleukin-6, which has been found to be elevated in some COVID-19 patients.Scientists are also studying similar drugs, anakinra and siltuximab.Another immune suppressant from Regeneron and Sanofi, called Kevzara, has had disappointing results in clinical trials. The manufacturers plan to continue studying the drug to see if it can help certain types of patients.Dr. Anar Yukhayev, a New York OB-GYN who was hospitalized with COVID-19 on March 16, agreed to join a clinical trial of Kevzara.“I was having so much trouble breathing that I was desperate for anything to help,” said Yukhayev, 31, who was treated at Long Island Jewish Medical Center.
About 36 hours after receiving an infusion, as Yukhayev was being treated in intensive care, his symptoms began to improve. He was able to avoid being put on a ventilator. Doctors didn’t tell him if he received Kevzara or a placebo, but his liver enzymes also began to rise, suggesting the organ was under stress. Elevated liver enzymes are a known side effect of Kevzara.Yukhayev made a full recovery and went back to work full time April 13. He donated his plasma to researchers.Until vaccines and other preventive medicines are developed, the best way to prevent coronavirus infections is to maintain social distancing, Adalja said.“Social distancing is a blunt tool,” he said, “but it’s all that we have.”",1
"At least five US teams have cloned antibodies to Covid-19, paving the way for cutting-edge treatments that could be what one researcher calls ""an immunity bridge"" before a vaccine comes along.The treatment is monoclonal antibody therapy, and the antibodies come from people who have recovered from the novel coronavirus. Researchers then take the blood, select the most potent antibodies, and make them into a drug.One company, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, hopes to have a treatment available to patients as early as the end of the summer.""I think monoclonal antibody therapy has enormous promise as the next big thing for Covid-19,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine specialist at Baylor University School of Medicine who is not involved in the research.Monoclonal antibody therapy is a modern take on convalescent plasma, where someone who has recovered from coronavirus donates blood to someone who is currently ill.Even if convalescent plasma is effective -- it's still being studied -- it has two shortcomings.First, one person can only give so much blood. Second, the donor might not have enough strong antibodies for the blood donation to be effective.To develop a monoclonal antibody treatment, researchers cull through thousands of antibodies to find the best ones, and then clone them potentially in unlimited amounts.Many other illnesses are treated with monoclonal antibodies, such as various forms of cancer, HIV, asthma, lupus, multiple sclerosis and various forms of cancer, but of course there's no guarantee it could work for Covid-19.""One of the things about the search is it's a little bit like finding a needle in a haystack. We're all searching for the magical antibody that's a silver bullet,"" said Dr. James Crowe, who's leading the Covid-19 monoclonal antibody effort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.Regeneron is hoping to start clinical trials for an antibody treatment for coronavirus in humans as soon as next month, and if everything goes right, perhaps have a treatment ready for widespread distribution by the end of the summer.""We generated thousands of [antibodies] and then selected the most powerful and potent ones to grow up into an antibody cocktail,"" said company president Dr. George Yancopoulos.Like any treatment under development, it might not pan out. But if it does, it could treat coronavirus and possibly also prevent infection for a period of time.A vaccine would likely offer longer lasting immunity, but that would likely take longer to develop, with the earliest estimates set at January.
""I think antibodies will be finished first, and will be the bridge toward longer immunity, which will be conferred by vaccines,"" said Crowe, director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.'A guided nuclear warhead'. In mid-January, researchers at the Rockefeller University in New York City heard from the National Institutes of Health: Get to work because we hope to have coronavirus antibodies cloned by the spring.About two months later, Rockefeller researcher Jill Horowitz found herself handing out fliers outside a supermarket in New Rochelle, New York, inviting people who'd recovered from coronavirus to learn more about the Rockefeller study.The city -- and in particular one synagogue -- had been hit hard by a coronavirus outbreak.""I'm Jewish, and I'm Orthodox, and I know people at Young Israel. I have friends in New Rochelle. Our kids went to school together, so I could go into the community and make my case,"" said Horowitz, executive director of strategic operations in the immunology laboratory at Rockefeller.
In all, more than 100 people donated blood for the study, many of them from the New Rochelle community. Some of their stories will be told in an upcoming documentary, ""Rebel Blood The Race to Cure Covid-19.""The lead scientist in Rockefeller's monoclonal antibody effort compares it to battle, noting that convalescent plasma has been used for more than a century.""If you're thinking about a war, and you're fighting a war with a drug that came out of the early part of the 20thcentury, the monoclonal antibody is like a guided nuclear warhead in comparison,"" said Dr. Michel Nussenzweig, a professor at Rockefeller.Research by several US teams.Several other US teams also say they've cloned antibodies, including Vanderbilt, Regeneron, Lilly Pharmaceuticals and Distributed Bio.Regeneron anticipates starting clinical trials next month and hopes to provide ""hundreds of thousands of doses"" to patients by the end of the summer, Yancopoulos said.The company already makes monoclonal antibodies for several illnesses, including cancer, arthritis and asthma.""We're using the same exact technology now to come up with a specific tailored approach against Covid-19,"" Yancopoulos said.Other companies gave a longer timeline. For example, Crowe, the doctor at Vanderbilt, said he anticipates it will be around the first quarter of next year before his team might have a Covid monoclonal antibody treatment ready to distribute.He said it's a good sign that several teams are working on monoclonal antibodies.""I think the more groups we have working on it, all the better, and the more shots on goal we have for getting an effective prevention or treatment,"" he said.",1
"Companies are launching trials at an unprecedented pace, but some worry about the trade-offs between speed and safety.Ian Haydon, a healthy 29-year-old, reported to a medical clinic in Seattle for a momentous blood draw last week.“Oh yeah,” said the nurse taking his blood. “That is liquid gold.”Haydon is an obscure but important participant in the most consequential race for a vaccine in medical history. In early April, he was among the first people in the United States to receive an experimental vaccine that could help end the coronavirus crisis. He volunteered to be a test subject knowing about the risks and unknowns, but eager to do his part to help end the worst pandemic in a century.Scientists at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., will study blood from Haydon and others for signs that the vaccine triggered an immune response to a pathogen they have never encountered. It would be the first, preliminary signal that the vaccine could provide immunity to covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which has claimed more than 200,000 lives worldwide.A coronavirus vaccine has become the light at the end of a very long tunnel, the tool that will bring the virus to heel, allowing people to attend sports events, hug friends, celebrate weddings and grieve at funerals. The goal to deliver a vaccine in 12 to 18 months, often repeated by the nation’s top infectious disease scientist, Anthony S. Fauci, has become the one reassuring refrain during briefings on the crisis. The White House put together a task force called Operation Warp Speed to try to move even faster, making hundreds of millions of doses ready by January.With at least 115 vaccine projects at companies and research labs, the science is hurtling forward so fast and bending so many rules about how the process usually works that even veteran vaccine developers do not know what to expect.Scientific steps that typically take place sequentially over years — animal testing, toxicology studies, laboratory experiments, massive human trials, plans to ramp up production — are now moving in fast-forward and in parallel. Experts keep using the word “unprecedented.”It’s a thrilling time in vaccine science, but also an unnerving one.U.S. regulators are firm in promising they will not sacrifice safety for speed, but some ethicists raise concerns about “pandemic research exceptionalism,” in which the demand to speed a vaccine to market could come at the expense of evidence and fuel the powerful anti-vaccine lobby.“The 26 years it took us to make the rotavirus vaccine is pretty typical. If it’s 12 to 18 months, you’re skipping steps,” said Paul Offit, who developed a vaccine for rotavirus, which causes deadly diarrhea in infants and children. “Is that a little risky? Yes it is, but so is getting infected with the virus.”Science at ‘lightning speed’. On a weekend in early January, scientists at Inovio Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company outside of Philadelphia, began designing a vaccine for a mysterious pneumonia that didn’t even have a name. They, like other teams around the world, used the genetic blueprint of the novel coronavirus, shared online by Chinese scientists, as their guide.It took about three hours to design the vaccine, said Joseph Kim, chief executive of Inovio.Scientists at NIH had been in talks about partnering with a Massachusetts biotechnology company, Moderna, and immediately began designing another vaccine candidate. By the end of the month, it was in production in a factory filled with robots in a suburb south of Boston.With an array of promising vaccine technologies fueled by early scientific openness, dozens of vaccine efforts kicked off blindingly fast in dozens of countries.“Then, the tough work began,” Kim said.Designing a promising vaccine is, in some ways, the easy part. Showing that it is safe and effective and then scaling up production can take years or even decades. Researchers are now trying to compress that timeline in ways they never have before, against a type of virus they have never successfully quelled. In some cases, they are also harnessing technologies that have never been used in approved vaccines. In contrast, scientists develop a new flu vaccine each year, an effort that is more of a “plug and play” situation, where a time-tested basic platform can be redirected to fight new flu strains.“It’s another reason for better preparedness,” said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at NIH, pointing out that his lab had developed a vaccine for MERS, a related coronavirus, but only got it through mouse studies. “If we’d taken at least two to three vaccine concepts through early-phase clinical trials on MERS, we might have a better idea on what to focus on for this SARS coronavirus — so instead of working with 115 different vaccine ideas, we might be working on five.”Scientists at Oxford University have announced the most aggressive timeline, with plans to make their vaccine — which depends on a weakened cold virus that typically infects chimpanzees — available in the fall.Moderna and Inovio are developing vaccines that ferry two types of genetic material into cells to train the immune system to recognize the distinctive “spike” protein on the surface of the coronavirus. A Beijing company is trying an inactivated virus. Giant pharmaceutical companies, flush with government funding, are turning their vaccine platforms toward the coronavirus. Researchers at Texas A&M University are repurposing an existing tuberculosis vaccine to see whether it can prevent deaths or severe illness.To make things more difficult, as the infection spread across the world, scientific teams had to change how they work, practicing social distancing in their labs so the virus doesn’t take out the effort to combat it. That happened at NIH, when one scientist became infected with the coronavirus and two close colleagues on the effort had to quarantine for 14 days.Graham’s Vaccine Research Center is working with only about 10 percent of its staff coming in, and his laboratory — which usually houses 20 people — can have only two at any one time.Meanwhile, the difficult laboratory science, such as animal testing, is in many ways, being leapfrogged or running in tandem with testing in people.“This is unusual,” Kim said. “It’s really moving at lightning speed with the urgency to match it.”Learning as they go
Many researchers can describe how vaccines are typically developed. But they can’t say precisely how the coronavirus vaccines will come about. So much will depend not just on the science, but on how the outbreak evolves, how flexible regulators decide to be and what we continue to learn about the virus in real time.Philanthropist Bill Gates argues things can’t really return to normal until the world’s 7 billion people are vaccinated — a daunting scenario that could take years and create a new kind of public strife, as governments and individual people scramble for limited doses. More than one vaccine will probably be needed because the first one may not be as effective as the follow-ups.The front-runner vaccines in the United States have never been made at an industrial scale, and some vaccines require two doses to be given, further complicating any effort to scale up.“We really have never made those kinds of vaccines in large, large quantities. How quickly can that be done?” said Kathryn Edwards, a professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “We’re not going to be able to say in 18 months that we have enough for all the world’s people to be immunized with two doses.”Typically, human clinical trials occur after extensive animal testing. Then, a small number of human subjects receive the vaccine in a phase 1 trial intended to determine the safety and the right dosage. People are monitored for any side effects, as well as early hints that the vaccine works. After carefully analyzing that data, companies decide to proceed to a larger phase 2 trial in several hundred patients, which looks for signs the vaccine is working. Then, they could proceed to a large phase 3 trial in which people are randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or a dummy shot — a definitive test of safety and effectiveness, which often takes thousands of patients and several years.Offit, who is helping advise the U.S. vaccine effort, said the “large” trials being considered that he is aware of range from 1,000 to 6,000 people that would probably take place over months. In contrast, when he developed a vaccine against rotavirus, the pivotal trial included 70,000 healthy infants over four years. The human papilloma virus vaccine was tested in 30,000 people.“Those are typical trials,” Offit said. “They tell you, pretty comfortably, that the vaccine is effective — and to some extent, that it doesn’t have an uncommon side effect.”No one is talking about that for the coronavirus.Moderna, the company that manufactures the vaccine Haydon received, plans to start its next larger trial in 500 to 600 people this spring, according to Stéphane Bancel, the chief executive. He said the company began planning the trial nearly a month ago, even though it was still giving shots to the first human subjects.
“We said, ‘We cannot wait,’” Bancel said.Instead of holding off until the subjects have signs in their blood that the vaccine works, they are going to proceed to the next trial as soon as it shows safety. Bancel said Moderna hopes to sign a contract soon with a government agency so that they can start manufacturing and stockpiling the vaccine before approval. They could have 100 million doses ready to go on day one, if it is approved in a year.Regulators insist that even under unprecedented urgency, products will be held to a high safety bar.“My motto is a woodworking one: Measure twice, cut once. The only change to that motto is: Measure quickly twice, cut quickly once,” said Peter Marks, the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.But vaccine experts point out that rare safety problems often can be identified only in very large studies or even through monitoring after a vaccine has been deployed. They are most concerned about the risk that the vaccines could actually make the disease worse in some people, as happened in some animal studies of vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), through a mechanism called antibody dependent enhancement.In 1966, for instance, an experimental vaccine for RSV, a common respiratory virus in children, backfired when some children developed a more severe disease. Scientific debate is still raging about a dengue vaccine used in the Philippines in recent years that increased the risk of hospitalization for dengue in children who had not previously been infected.
The public’s health — and the trust in vaccines, considered one of the most successful public health interventions in human history — will be guarded by regulators, experts say, even as the political pressure intensifies to get a vaccine into broad use.“They’re good at holding the line and aren’t going to do anything that’s reckless because if they did it, could jeopardize the whole U.S. vaccine effort, especially with the anti-vaccine lobby,” said Peter Jay Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.Human experiments
One way to speed up vaccine development is “human challenge” experiments, in which people are intentionally infected with the virus after being vaccinated. While the idea has gained steam among some scientists, people working on vaccine trials said it is an ethically challenging approach they would be uncomfortable with unless an effective treatment is discovered.“Right now, I think it’s a little premature. However, it’s not off the table,” said Wilbur Chen, chief of the adult clinical studies section in the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. “I think it could be something that could be done; it could help us to really evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine much more quickly.”Volunteers for such a challenge effort have already flooded an online sign-up created by a grass-roots group of researchers. Scientists are hopeful that enthusiasm will fill up all the trials necessary to prove the vaccines work. That will mean people willing to be test subjects for unproven vaccines with thinner-than-usual animal evidence behind them. It will mean people volunteering for trials in which half of them get a placebo. It may mean people weighing a vaccine whose benefits and risks aren’t fully known against the risk of the virus.Haydon, who is due for his second shot of the vaccine next week, said he had never participated in a research study but was eager to assist.“I’m incredibly hopeful we’ll arrive at a vaccine,” he said. “But in order to do that, we need clinical trials — and at some point, for each new vaccine and each new drug, that has to go into someone for the first time.”",1
"The science behind what makes this coronavirus so sneaky, deadly and difficult to defeat. Viruses have spent billions of years perfecting the art of surviving without living — a frighteningly effective strategy that makes them a potent threat in today’s world.That’s especially true of the deadly new coronavirus that has brought global society to a screeching halt. It’s little more than a packet of genetic material surrounded by a spiky protein shell one-thousandth the width of an eyelash, and it leads such a zombielike existence that it’s barely considered a living organism.
But as soon as it gets into a human airway, the virus hijacks our cells to create millions more versions of itself.Researchers hope new visualization of SARS-CoV-2 will show them how to defeat it.There is a certain evil genius to how this coronavirus pathogen works: It finds easy purchase in humans without them knowing. Before its first host even develops symptoms, it is already spreading its replicas everywhere, moving onto its next victim. It is powerfully deadly in some but mild enough in others to escape containment. And for now, we have no way of stopping it.As researchers race to develop drugs and vaccines for the disease that has already sickened 350,000 and killed more than 15,000 people, and counting, this is a scientific portrait of what they are up against.‘Between chemistry and biology’, Respiratory viruses tend to infect and replicate in two places: In the nose and throat, where they are highly contagious, or lower in the lungs, where they spread less easily but are much more deadly.This new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, adeptly cuts the difference. It dwells in the upper respiratory tract, where it is easily sneezed or coughed onto its next victim. But in some patients, it can lodge itself deep within the lungs, where the disease can kill. That combination gives it the contagiousness of some colds, along with some of the lethality of its close molecular cousin SARS, which caused a 2002-2003 outbreak in Asia.Another insidious characteristic of this virus: By giving up that bit of lethality, its symptoms emerge less readily than those of SARS, which means people often pass it to others before they even know they have it.It is, in other words, just sneaky enough to wreak worldwide havoc.Viruses much like this one have been responsible for many of the most destructive outbreaks of the past 100 years: the flus of 1918, 1957 and 1968; and SARS, MERS and Ebola. Like the coronavirus, all these diseases are zoonotic — they jumped from an animal population into humans. And all are caused by viruses that encode their genetic material in RNA.That’s no coincidence, scientists say. The zombielike existence of RNA viruses makes them easy to catch and hard to kill.Outside a host, viruses are dormant. They have none of the traditional trappings of life: metabolism, motion, the ability to reproduce.And they can last this way for quite a long time. Recent laboratory research showed that, although SARS-CoV-2 typically degrades in minutes or a few hours outside a host, some particles can remain viable — potentially infectious — on cardboard for up to 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel for up to three days. In 2014, a virus frozen in permafrost for 30,000 years that scientists retrieved was able to infect an amoeba after being revived in the lab.When viruses encounter a host, they use proteins on their surfaces to unlock and invade its unsuspecting cells. Then they take control of those cells’ molecular machinery to produce and assemble the materials needed for more viruses.“It’s switching between alive and not alive,” said Gary Whittaker, a Cornell University professor of virology. He described a virus as being somewhere “between chemistry and biology.”Among RNA viruses, coronaviruses — named for the protein spikes that adorn them like points of a crown — are unique for their size and relative sophistication. They are three times bigger than the pathogens that cause dengue, West Nile and Zika, and are capable of producing extra proteins that bolster their success.“Let’s say dengue has a tool belt with only one hammer,” said Vineet Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch. This coronavirus has three different hammers, each for a different situation.Among those tools is a proofreading protein, which allows coronaviruses to fix some errors that happen during the replication process. They can still mutate faster than bacteria but are less likely to produce offspring so riddled with detrimental mutations that they can’t survive.Meanwhile, the ability to change helps the germ adapt to new environments, whether it’s a camel’s gut or the airway of a human unknowingly granting it entry with an inadvertent scratch of her nose.
Scientists believe that the SARS virus originated as a bat virus that reached humans via civet cats sold in animal markets. This current virus, which can also be traced to bats, is thought to have had an intermediate host, possibly an endangered scaly anteater called a pangolin.“I think nature has been telling us over the course of 20 years that, ‘Hey, coronaviruses that start out in bats can cause pandemics in humans, and we have to think of them as being like influenza, as long-term threats,’” said Jeffery Taubenberger, virologist with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Funding for research on coronaviruses increased after the SARS outbreak, but in recent years that funding has dried up, Taubenberger said. Such viruses usually simply cause colds and were not considered as important as other viral pathogens, he said.The search for weapons. Once inside a cell, a virus can make 10,000 copies of itself in a matter of hours. Within a few days, the infected person will carry hundreds of millions of viral particles in every teaspoon of his blood.The onslaught triggers an intense response from the host’s immune system: Defensive chemicals are released. The body’s temperature rises, causing fever. Armies of germ-eating white blood cells swarm the infected region. Often, this response is what makes a person feel sick.Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University, compared viruses to particularly destructive burglars: They break into your home, eat your food, use your furniture and have 10,000 babies. “And then they leave the place trashed,” he said.Unfortunately, humans have few defenses against these burglars.Most antimicrobials work by interfering with the functions of the germs they target. For example, penicillin blocks a molecule used by bacteria to build their cell walls. The drug works against thousands of kinds of bacteria, but because human cells don’t use that protein, we can ingest it without being harmed.But viruses function through us. With no cellular machinery of their own, they become intertwined with ours. Their proteins are our proteins. Their weaknesses are our weaknesses. Most drugs that might hurt them would hurt us, too.For this reason, antiviral drugs must be extremely targeted and specific, said Stanford virologist Karla Kirkegaard. They tend to target proteins produced by the virus (using our cellular machinery) as part of its replication process. These proteins are unique to their viruses. This means the drugs that fight one disease generally don’t work across multiple ones.And because viruses evolve so quickly, the few treatments scientists do manage to develop don’t always work for long. This is why scientists must constantly develop new drugs to treat HIV, and why patients take a “cocktail” of antivirals that viruses must mutate multiple times to resist.
“Modern medicine is constantly needing to catch up to new emerging viruses,” Kirkegaard said.SARS-CoV-2 is particularly enigmatic. Though its behavior is different from that of its cousin SARS, there are no obvious differences in the viruses’ spiky protein “keys” that allow them to invade host cells.
Understanding these proteins could be critical to developing a vaccine, said Alessandro Sette, head of the center for infectious disease at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. Previous research has shown that the spike proteins on SARS are what trigger the immune system’s protective response. In a paper published this month, Sette found the same is true of SARS-CoV-2.This gives scientists reason for optimism, according to Sette. It affirms researchers’ hunch that the spike protein is a good target for vaccines. If people are inoculated with a version of that protein, it could teach their immune system to recognize the virus and allow them to respond to the invader more quickly.
“It also says the novel coronavirus is not that novel,” Sette said.And if SARS-CoV-2 is not so different from its older cousin SARS, then the virus is probably not evolving very fast, giving scientists developing vaccines time to catch up.In the meantime, Kirkegaard said, the best weapons we have against the coronavirus are public health measures, such as testing and social distancing, and our own immune systems.Some virologists believe we have one other thing working in our favor: the virus itself.For all its evil genius and efficient, lethal design, Kirkegaard said, “the virus doesn’t really want to kill us. It’s good for them, good for their population, if you’re walking around being perfectly healthy.”Evolutionarily speaking, experts believe, the ultimate goal of viruses is to be contagious while also gentle on their hosts — less a destructive burglar and more a considerate house guest.That’s because highly lethal viruses like SARS and Ebola tend to burn themselves out, leaving no one alive to spread them.But a germ that’s merely annoying can perpetuate itself indefinitely. One 2014 study found that the virus causing oral herpes has been with the human lineage for 6 million years. “That’s a very successful virus,” Kirkegaard said.Seen through this lens, the novel coronavirus that is killing thousands across the world is still early in its life. It replicates destructively, unaware that there’s a better way to survive.But bit by bit, over time, its RNA will change. Until one day, not so far in the future, it will be just another one of the handful of common cold coronaviruses that circulate every year, giving us a cough or sniffle and nothing more.",1
"Researchers hope that a new visualization of the architecture of SARS-CoV-2 will show them how to defeat it.Like any virus, the novel coronavirus is a germ that tries to burrow into a cell and turn it into a virus-replicating factory. If it succeeds, it can produce an infection — in this case, a respiratory disease. The type of cells a virus targets and how it enters them depend on how the virus is built.This virus gets its family name from a telltale series of spikes — tens or even hundreds of them — that circle its bloblike core like a crown, or corona. Virologists know from studying its close cousins, viruses that cause SARS and MERS, that the spikes interact with receptors on cells like keys in locks, enabling the virus to enter.Very recent innovations in imaging techniques enabled researchers to peer so closely at the novel virus’s spikes that they created a model of one, right down to the atoms, and are beginning to reveal its secrets.It has a clever disguise.Sugars dot the outside of the spike, just like sugars dot the outside of regular human cells, said David Veesler, a structural virologist at the University of Washington who led a team that visualized the SARS-CoV-2 spike and published a March 19 paper on its architecture.This carbohydrate camouflage makes the virus more difficult for the human immune system to recognize.t seems to attach by opening and closing.Each spike is made of three identical proteins twisted together, Veesler said.His team captured images of the ends of these proteins opening in the spike’s cap-like apex before and during the attempt to bind to a receptor. Studies on SARS- and MERS-causing viruses indicate that all three proteins in a spike have to open for it to gain access to a cell.Experts say a vaccine is at least a year away, but they’re coming up with strategies now.One may be able to trigger antibodies that strike areas of the protein that are exposed when it opens, said virologist Vineet Menachery, who specializes in the study of coronaviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.The holy grail of vaccines, Veesler said, would trigger antibodies that attack a spike’s stem, which is so similar to other coronaviruses that a single vaccine might protect against several strains instead of just one.One treatment avenue may be to block receptors so the spikes have nowhere to attach.Perhaps a concert of strategies could work together against these tiny invaders, each 1,000 times smaller than the cells they infect. After all, the natural human immune response plays defense in many ways at once.While we wait for a vaccine, we have ways to defeat it.Soap — bar soap, liquid soap, laundry detergent and such — is virus kryptonite, which is why the message “Wash your hands!” is everywhere. But Menachery said heat and ultraviolet light are two other ways to neutralize a coronavirus, and each of these methods works in a different way.After about 20 seconds of contact, soap breaks apart the fragile, fatty membrane that holds the virus together. Disinfecting agents with at least 60 percent alcohol puncture and destroy the virus in a similar way.Extreme heat — near boiling — causes the proteins in the spikes to unravel and lose their shape, deactivating them. A human fever is not hot enough to do this; it’s unclear what effect warm summer weather will have.And ultraviolet light has been used as a disinfectant for a century in hospitals and water supplies. It shatters the genetic material inside viruses, bacteria and other microbes. However, it doesn’t always work uniformly, Menachery said, and disinfecting UV light can’t be used with people around because it damages human cells.

"After the first case of covid-19, the disease caused by the new strain of coronavirus, was announced in the United States, reports of further infections trickled in slowly. Two months later, that trickle has turned into a steady current.This so-called exponential curve has experts worried. If the number of cases were to continue to double every three days, there would be about a hundred million cases in the United States by May.That is math, not prophecy. The spread can be slowed, public health professionals say, if people practice “social distancing” by avoiding public spaces and generally limiting their movement.Still, without any measures to slow it down, covid-19 will continue to spread exponentially for months. To understand why, it is instructive to simulate the spread of a fake disease through a population.We will call our fake disease simulitis. It spreads even more easily than covid-19: whenever a healthy person comes into contact with a sick person, the healthy person becomes sick, too.In a population of just five people, it did not take long for everyone to catch simulitis.In real life, of course, people eventually recover. A recovered person can neither transmit simulitis to a healthy person nor become sick again after coming in contact with a sick person.Let’s see what happens when simulitis spreads in a town of 200 people. We will start everyone in town at a random position, moving at a random angle, and we will make one person sick.Notice how the slope of the red curve, which represents the number of sick people, rises rapidly as the disease spreads and then tapers off as people recover.Our simulation town is small — about the size of Whittier, Alaska — so simulitis was able to spread quickly across the entire population. In a country like the United States, with its 330 million people, the curve could steepen for a long time before it started to slow.When it comes to the real covid-19, we would prefer to slow the spread of the virus before it infects a large portion of the U.S. population. To slow simulitis, let’s try to create a forced quarantine, such as the one the Chinese government imposed on Hubei province, covid-19’s ground zero.Whoops! As health experts would expect, it proved impossible to completely seal off the sick population from the healthy.Leana Wen, the former health commissioner for the city of Baltimore, explained the impracticalities of forced quarantines to The Washington Post in January. “Many people work in the city and live in neighboring counties, and vice versa,“ Wen said. “Would people be separated from their families? How would every road be blocked? How would supplies reach residents?”As Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, put it: “The truth is those kinds of lockdowns are very rare and never effective.”Fortunately, there are other ways to slow an outbreak. Above all, health officials have encouraged people to avoid public gatherings, to stay home more often and to keep their distance from others. If people are less mobile and interact with each other less, the virus has fewer opportunities to spread.Some people will still go out. Maybe they cannot stay home because of their work or other obligations, or maybe they simply refuse to heed public health warnings. Those people are not only more likely to get sick themselves, they are more likely to spread simulitis, too.Let’s see what happens when a quarter of our population continues to move around while the other three quarters adopt a strategy of what health experts call “social distancing.”More social distancing keeps even more people healthy, and people can be nudged away from public places by removing their allure.“We control the desire to be in public spaces by closing down public spaces. Italy is closing all of its restaurants. China is closing everything, and we are closing things now, too,” said Drew Harris, a population health researcher and assistant professor at The Thomas Jefferson University College of Public Health. “Reducing the opportunities for gathering helps folks social distance.”To simulate more social distancing, instead of allowing a quarter of the population to move, we will see what happens when we let just one of every eight people move.The four simulations you just watched — a free-for-all, an attempted quarantine, moderate social distancing and extensive social distancing — were random. That means the results of each one were unique to your reading of this article; if you scroll up and rerun the simulations, or if you revisit this page later, your results will change.Even with different results, moderate social distancing will usually outperform the attempted quarantine, and extensive social distancing usually works best of all. Below is a comparison of your results.Simulitis is not covid-19, and these simulations vastly oversimplify the complexity of real life. Yet just as simulitis spread through the networks of bouncing balls on your screen, covid-19 is spreading through our human networks — through our countries, our towns, our workplaces, our families. And, like a ball bouncing across the screen, a single person’s behavior can cause ripple effects that touch faraway people.In one crucial respect, though, these simulations are nothing like reality: Unlike simulitis, covid-19 can kill. Though the fatality rate is not precisely known, it is clear that the elderly members of our community are most at risk of dying from covid-19.“If you want this to be more realistic,” Harris said after seeing a preview of this story, “some of the dots should disappear.”",1
"These days, “coronavirus” is often prefaced with the word “novel,” because that’s precisely what it is: a new strain in a family of viruses we’ve all seen before — and, in some form, had. According to the WHO, coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that range from the common cold to much more serious diseases. These diseases can infect both humans and animals. The strain that began spreading in Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province, is related to two other coronaviruses that have caused major outbreaks in recent years: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
Symptoms of a coronavirus infection range in severity from respiratory problems to cases of pneumonia, kidney failure and a buildup of fluid in the lungs. They may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus.In April, the CDC added new symptoms of the disease to its list, shedding more light on how the virus infects patients. The symptoms now include: a cough, shortness of breath, fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and a loss of taste or smell.Covid-19 spreads more easily than SARS and is similar to other coronaviruses that cause cold-like symptoms, experts have said. It appears to be highly transmissible, and since cases are mild, the disease may be more widespread than current testing numbers suggest.",1
"Public health officials say the novel coronavirus is less deadly than SARS, which killed about 10 percent of people who were infected during the outbreak that began in 2002. But epidemiologists are still trying to determine exactly how deadly covid-19 is.Similar to other respiratory illnesses, older people and those with illnesses such as diabetes and high blood pressure are at increased risk. Data show that the virus is killing more men than women in the U.S.But, as with other diseases, there can be tremendous individual variation in how people respond. There will be people with known risk factors who recover as well as people who develop severe cases for reasons we don’t understand.There’s also no evidence that children are more prone to contracting covid-19, according to the CDC, and that was also the case with the disease′s cousins, SARS and MERS.",1

If unchecked Internet information is any guide, there’s an inexhaustible list of products you should buy to prepare for the spread of the coronavirus in the United States — which, according to U.S. health officials, was inevitable.But here’s the thing: The virus may be novel, but you really don’t need to buy anything new or special to brace for it.

How to prepare for coronavirus in the U.S.What does it mean to prepare for an outbreak?While there is no vaccine for covid-19, preventive steps and awareness are the best tools to prepare and protect yourself in the event of an outbreak.

If unchecked Internet information is any guide, there’s an inexhaustible list of products you should buy to prepare for the spread of the coronavirus in the United States — which, according to U.S. health officials, was inevitable.But here’s the thing: The virus may be novel, but you really don’t need to buy anything new or special to brace for it. The Washington Post spoke to epidemiology experts, and they said the most important aspect of preparedness costs nothing at all — calm.There have been more than 1,000 confirmed cases of the virus in the United States and at least 31 deaths.Days ago, as health officials across the country began identifying new cases, a study indicated that the coronavirus had been circulating in Washington state for more than a month, possibly infecting scores of people. The preliminary research came as federal agencies announced steps to expand testing for the virus, which causes a highly infectious respiratory disease called covid-19.While the total number of U.S. cases is relatively low compared with China and, now, Italy, experts say it is still a good time for individuals, businesses, health-care systems and schools to reexamine their pandemic preparedness plans to make sure they’re ready.So here’s what doctors, researchers and the CDC say you can do now — and in the event of a future outbreak — to prepare and protect yourself.‘Don’t panic’.Timothy Brewer is a professor of epidemiology and medicine at UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health and its David Geffen School of Medicine, yet his central piece of advice is not exactly medical.“Don’t panic,” he said. “There’s no value in panicking or telling people to be afraid. Don’t let fear and emotion drive the response to this virus. That can be extremely difficult because it is new, and we’re still learning about it, but don’t allow fear of what we don’t know about the virus to overwhelm what we do know.”
Brewer said it’s important to remember that covid-19 is a respiratory disease, as is influenza, and while there’s not a vaccine for it, there are tried-and-true ways to deal with this type of illness — which we will cover here.The basics.A few minutes into a phone call with a reporter, Brewer paused, coughed and then explained himself. “I’m currently recovering from a non-covid respiratory virus,” he said.But the precautions he took when fighting his influenza-like illness are no different from what people should be doing every day to stave off coronavirus and other respiratory diseases, Brewer said.You have seen the guidance before: Wash your hands regularly. Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze. And when you’re sick, stay home from work or school and drink lots of fluids. The CDC recommends washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose or sneezing. It also advises not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth and to clean objects and surfaces you touch often — a common household cleaner will suffice.“These are all things you can do to prevent the spread of pretty much any respiratory virus,” Brewer said.And for the record, he added, he stayed home sick last week.“I practiced what I preached,” Brewer said.Don’t touch your face.It’s exactly what will make you sick, but it’s so hard to stop. A 2015 study found that we touch our face an average of two dozen times an hour, and 44 percent of that touching involves contact with eyes, nose or mouth.All that touching is risky. People are more likely to get the coronavirus by picking it up from a surface and touching their face than they are to breathe in droplets directly from someone who is infected, said William Sawyer, a family doctor in Sharonville, Ohio.
“They will give it to themselves, not the person down the hall,” he said.Not touching your facial mucous membranes, an area known as the T-zone, is perhaps the most important step you can take to prevent an infection, said Sawyer.How do you stop? You have to “outsmart” your habit, said Elliot Berkman, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon who studies habits and behaviors. One way to do that quickly is to change something in your environment, he said. Wear something on your hands or face (not a mask if you’re not sick) that can serve as a cue, an interruption to an automatic action.If you have an urge to scratch, cover your finger with a tissue first, said Sawyer. Avoid touching your face with a bare hand, but also know that gloves can pick up germs just as easily.Keep the shopping cart light
You probably don’t need to buy anything new, but if you’re already on your way to the drugstore, Brewer has some advice.
“Don’t go crazy,” he said. “You don’t need to go out and stock up on lots of things.”And those surgical masks? The U.S. surgeon general has some words about those.“Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!” Jerome M. Adams tweeted. “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!”Brewer says masks are used to keep someone who is infected from spreading it to others. If you’re not sick, you don’t need to wear one, and if you do, it’s not preventing you from getting sick. Common surgical masks block the droplets coming out of a sick person from getting into the air, but they are not tight enough to prevent what’s already in the air from getting in.
The CDC agrees, writing on its website, “CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a face mask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases.”There are specialized masks — known as N95 masks because they filter out 95 percent of airborne particles — that are more effective, and many retailers have sold out of them. But there’s a problem: The masks are difficult to use without training. They must be fitted and tested to work properly.“If you just buy them at CVS, you’re not going to do all that,” Brewer said. “You’re not going to get it fit-tested, and you’re not going to be wearing it properly, so all you’ve done is spend a lot of money on a very fancy face mask.”The same goes for exam gloves, Brewer said, which can get contaminated just like our hands. There’s no need for them if you’re washing your hands properly and often, he said.If you’re itching to buy something, you can stick to the typical respiratory-virus medicine: decongestants, anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen for fevers.‘Practice makes permanent’.“A lot of preparedness is planning ahead of time,” said Saskia V. Popescu, a senior infection-prevention epidemiologist for a Phoenix-based hospital system. “Practice makes permanent. If I have a plan, that means I don’t have to panic.”You should have a plan for child care, for getting to work and for feeding pets, she said. That’s good advice in general, she added, not just in the age of coronavirus.“This is a good reminder to go through your resources and your plans so that, should it get more serious, you are not taken off guard,” she said. “People think they need to go out and buy stuff, but so much of it is just having a plan.”Consider the kids.There is no evidence that children are more prone to contracting covid-19, according to the CDC. In fact, as The Post’s William Wan and Joel Achenbach reported, “one of the few mercies of the spreading coronavirus is that it leaves young children virtually untouched.”What few reports the CDC does have indicate symptoms in children look a lot like symptoms in adults: fever, runny nose and cough. But severe complications are uncommon in children.Even though their risk isn’t any higher than it is for adults, the coronavirus could spread rapidly between children simply because of the germ-intense nature of schools. The CDC recommends teaching your kids good preventive habits for all illnesses — make sure their vaccinations are up to date, including for influenza; wash hands frequently using soap and water or hand sanitizer; avoid people who are sick.Most important, if your child has any symptoms of illness, keep them home from school to prevent the spread of illness, whether it’s the coronavirus or not.Be mindful of where you are.Health officials have stressed keeping your distance from people who are sick, especially when it comes to respiratory viruses. It is worth considering limiting exposure to large groups, especially during flu season, and more and more institutions and jurisdictions are now mandating such social distancing.“Any congregation of people is a setup for spreading an infectious agent,” said Stanley Perlman, an infectious-disease expert at the University of Iowa.Most of us like to look at our smartphones and wear headphones, but in confined spaces, such as mass transit, it’s important to look around and see what’s going on, to see where everyone’s hands are going and make a mental note to wash up later.Popescu recommends avoiding the middle of a packed train car and doing your best to turn away if someone is coughing nearby.But awareness cuts both ways. While the United States is going to have more coronavirus cases, she said, it is important not to panic. “Just because someone has the sniffles or has a cough, it doesn’t mean they have the coronavirus,” she said. “There are a lot of respiratory viruses.”Watch what you read.Misinformation about coronavirus is spreading fast. Popescu and other experts call this an “infodemic,” and it can be as harmful as any disease. Hoaxes, lies and junk science about the coronavirus have swirled online since the earliest cases were reported, mostly through social media.“People are more click-susceptible during these events because there’s more info and people aren’t sure who to trust,” University of Washington researcher Jevin West told The Post this month.Look to trustworthy sources, such as the CDC, the World Health Organization and local health departments, to stay informed, Popescu said — not the anonymous user doling out advice in Twitter mentions.“It can be really easy to go online, buy supplies and freak out, and then just stay on Facebook,” she said. “But stay up to date.”Avoid drastic financial decisions.The frenzy over what the virus could mean for the global economy caused the worst weekly loss for stocks since the 2008 financial crisis. That was followed by one of the worst single days on Wall Street since the Great Recession.While some families might be concerned about money tied up in the market, making drastic decisions is unnecessary, according to Xi Chen, assistant professor of public and global health and economics at the Yale School of Public Health.“The key thing is how long [the stock plunge] can last,” he said. “If it’s short-term, it might not affect the supply chain.”Chen pointed to severe acute respiratory syndrome, better known as SARS, which affected 24 countries in Asia, Europe and North and South America in the early 2000s, as a time when the market suffered for about a quarter before recovering with very strong growth.Don’t forget the flu shot.The coronavirus includes flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the CDC. Getting a flu shot could ease people’s concerns about the new virus and also help health professionals, said Albert Ko, department chair and professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health.“The best thing people can do is get immunized for influenza to free up services for people who come in with coronavirus,” he said, noting that initial signs of illness for flu and coronavirus closely mirror each other. “When we’re testing people [for coronavirus], it reduces the noise about who has it.”
Be kind.On college campuses, at a music conservatory, in Chinese restaurants, among the ranks of a famous dance troupe and on streets every day, Asians have reported a rise in aggression, micro and macro.As the coronavirus has spread, so has anti-Asian prejudice.The WHO has urged government agencies to do what they can to prevent discrimination against specific populations, since stigmatization can fuel the spread of the outbreak by driving marginalized individuals to hide infection and avoid seeking treatment.“Remember to not let fear override your common humanity about how you treat other people,” Brewer said. “Just remember we’re all in this together. This is a virus. It does not think. It is not planning. We shouldn’t be blaming our neighbors or our fellow colleagues or people in the community because a virus happens to exist and is spreading.”",1
"The coronavirus has killed more than 1,300 people, brought a huge swath of central China to a standstill and rattled millions around the globe with hints of a pandemic seen in Hollywood fantasies.But the virus’s destructive potential has overshadowed one encouraging aspect of this outbreak: So far, about 82 percent of the cases — including all 14 in the United States — have been mild, with symptoms that require little or no medical intervention. And that proportion may be an undercount.Health authorities managing the outbreak are trying to understand what that critical fact portends. Are the 60,000 sick people tallied so far just a portion of a vast reservoir of uncounted victims, some of whom may be spreading the disease? And do the mild illnesses reveal characteristics of the virus itself — something that could be useful in crafting a more effective response?“The fact that there are so many mild cases is a real hallmark of this disease and makes it so different from SARS,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Center for Health Security. “It’s also really challenging. Most of our surveillance is oriented around finding people who require medical intervention.”In China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, the number of new infections rose by 14,840 in a count released Thursday, with 242 new deaths, as health officials there broadened the criteria they are using to confirm cases.World Health Organization expert Michael Ryan said in a news briefing this week that, outside of Hubei province, the virus’s behavior did not seem to be as aggressive or accelerated.For those who study viruses, the large number of mild cases is reason for optimism. “This looks to be a bad, heightened cold — I think that’s a rational way of thinking about it,” said Matthew Frieman, a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “Not to diminish its importance — it’s in the middle between SARS and the common cold.”Though the virus was identified just six weeks ago, some of its characteristics are becoming clear. For the elderly and those with underlying heart disease, diabetes or other conditions, the disease can be quite severe. They are the ones dominating the ranks of the dead, often after pneumonia or other respiratory problems that lead to organ failure.Others are not suffering nearly as much. Healthy, younger adults seem to do better, and there have been few fatalities among children, for reasons that have caused much speculation among experts.“It could be that some people have an immune response that results in severe illness and some people don’t,” Nuzzo said. “It is common . . . in coronaviruses that there is a spectrum of illness.”At a presentation on the disease hosted Tuesday by the Aspen Institute in Washington, Nancy Messonnier, an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted that only a few of the 14 U.S. patients required oxygen during convalescence.“All the patients in the U.S. haven’t required tons of excessive care and actually, right now, they’re actually all improving,” said Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “Based on the U.S. experience, and based on the experience of other countries outside China, a lot of these patients seem to be doing okay.”But Messonnier and others are less confident about what that might signify. She noted that U.S. officials set a very low threshold for illness as they began their search for people with the disease among returnees from central China.“If we hadn’t been looking so hard,” she suggested, “we might not have found them.”Another possibility, said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, is that the U.S. patients were a self-selected sample of fairly healthy people — hardy enough, at least, to travel to Wuhan and back. Twelve of the U.S. patients were such travelers, while two others were spouses who came in contact with them after they returned.Schaffner also noted that in China, where the vast majority of deaths and illnesses from the “covid-19” disease have occurred, air pollution and a higher smoking prevalence may contribute to the severity of the disease.Many experts have said early phases of outbreaks like this one tend to have a large number of severe cases, as the sickest people flock to hospitals and come to doctors’ attention. And in Wuhan, where the health-care system is overwhelmed, people have complained they cannot find a hospital to test them for the virus, let alone to treat their symptoms. So patients with milder versions may be at home, uncounted, waiting out the epidemic.In its latest “situation report,” released Wednesday, the World Health Organization listed 45,171 confirmed cases in 25 countries including China, with just 441 of the cases outside China. The WHO classified 8,204 of the Chinese cases as severe, meaning virtually all the rest are mild.The WHO does not break down the cases outside China, but some countries do. Singapore, for example, has reported that 15 of its 50 patients have fully recovered and been discharged. Most of the others still hospitalized are “stable or improving,” while eight are in critical condition in intensive care.Currently, the death rate of the disease is hovering around ­2.5 percent, a remarkably high level, about the rate of the 1918 flu pandemic that killed roughly ­50 million people around the world. Normal seasonal flu kills less than one-tenth of one percent of people who contract the virus.But experts have said the coronavirus fatality rate is likely to decline substantially as they compile a more accurate count of the people who contract the virus and survive. At the Aspen Institute presentation, Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he hoped the rate could decline toward 1 percent.Either figure makes the virus much less deadly than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which killed more than ­9 percent of the people who contracted it in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which kills nearly 35 percent of its victims.The mild nature of many illnesses, some experts said, may stem from the properties of the pathogen itself. For reasons scientists still don’t fully understand, one virus may be a nuisance and a very similar one can be deadly. While two different coronaviruses produced SARS and MERS, four others cause about 30 percent of all common colds.The severity of the resulting illness is “inherent in the virus,” said Frieman, the University of Maryland virologist.One coronavirus that causes cold symptoms, called NL63, uses the same doorway into cells and infects the same cells as SARS, he said.“One gives you a runny nose and the other gives you lethal pneumonia,” Frieman said. “No one studies this.”A major question to be answered is who is most at risk. While many are focused on the overall death rate from the virus, Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said it is important to focus on the fatality rate in vulnerable groups.“SARS was 10 percent overall, but it was 50 percent among older people,” Hotez said. Figuring out who is most at risk is essential for creating the right public health strategy.“If you really want to address this epidemic, it’s especially important we protect the vulnerable groups,” Hotez said.",1
"Scientists are developing more than 100 coronavirus vaccines using a range of techniques, some of which are well-established and some of which have never been approved for medical use before.Most of these vaccines target the so-called spike proteins that cover the virus and help it invade human cells. The immune system can develop antibodies that latch onto spike proteins and stop the virus.A successful vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus would teach people’s immune systems to make antibodies against the virus without causing disease.Whole-Virus Vaccines.Vaccines that modify the entire coronavirus to provoke an immune response.Inactivated and Live Attenuated Vaccines.Most vaccines in use today incorporate an inactivated or weakened form of a virus that is not able to cause disease. When immune cells encounter them, they make antibodies.Making these vaccines means growing viruses — and lots of them. Influenza vaccines are typically grown in chicken eggs, and other vaccines are grown in tanks full of floating cells. These procedures can take months to produce a batch of new vaccines.EXAMPLES: Conventional vaccines for influenza, chickenpox, measles, mumps and rubella all fall into this category.COMPANIES DEVELOPING SARS-COV-2 VACCINES: Sinovac and others.Genetic Vaccines.Vaccines that use part of the coronavirus’s genetic code.DNA Vaccines.A number of experimental coronavirus vaccines don’t deliver whole viruses. Instead, they deliver genetic instructions for building a viral protein. The protein can then stimulate the immune system to make antibodies and help mount other defenses against the coronavirus.One of these genetic approaches is known as a DNA vaccine. A circle of engineered DNA is delivered into cells. The cells read the viral gene, make a copy in a molecule called messenger RNA, and then use the mRNA to assemble viral proteins. The immune system detects the proteins and mounts defenses.Prototype DNA vaccines based on the spike protein protected monkeys from the coronavirus.EXAMPLES: DNA vaccines have been approved for veterinary cases such as canine melanoma and West Nile virus in horses. There are no approved DNA vaccines for use in humans, but researchers are running trials to see if they might be effective for diseases such as Zika and the flu.COMPANIES: Inovio and others.RNA Vaccines. Some researchers want to skip DNA and instead deliver messenger RNA into cells. The cells read the mRNA and make spike proteins that provoke an immune response.The biotech company Moderna recently completed a small safety trial with eight volunteers that showed promising early results against the coronavirus.
Both RNA and DNA vaccines can be produced more quickly than traditional methods.EXAMPLES: There are no approved RNA vaccines, but they are in clinical trials for MERS and other diseases.Viral Vector Vaccines. Vaccines that use a virus to deliver coronavirus genes into cells.Vaccines Using Adenovirus or Other Viruses
Viruses are very good at getting into cells. Since the 1990s, researchers have been investigating how to use them to deliver genes into cells to immunize people against diseases.To create a coronavirus vaccine, several teams have added the spike protein gene to a virus called an adenovirus. The adenovirus slips into cells and unloads the gene. Because the adenovirus is missing one of its own genes, it cannot replicate and is therefore safe.EXAMPLES: Several virus vector vaccines are used to vaccinate animals against rabies and distemper. Johnson & Johnson has developed H.I.V. and Ebola vaccines using an adenovirus. Both have proven safe in humans and are now in efficacy trials.Protein-Based Vaccines.Vaccines that use a coronavirus protein or a protein fragment.Virus-Like Particle Vaccines.Some vaccines are particles that contain pieces of viral proteins. They can’t cause disease because they are not actual viruses, but they can still show the immune system what coronavirus proteins look like.EXAMPLES: The vaccine for HPV falls into this category.COMPANIES: Medicago, Doherty Institute and others.Recombinant Vaccines.Yeast or other cells can be engineered to carry a virus’s gene and spew out viral proteins, which are then harvested and put into a vaccine. A coronavirus vaccine of this design would contain whole spike proteins or small pieces of the protein.EXAMPLES: This category includes some vaccines for shingles and hepatitis B.COMPANIES: Novavax and others.",1
"China has ordered an unprecedented quarantine of more than 50 million people. It has closed schools and shut down live animal markets. Airports across the globe are screening passengers coming from the world’s most populous country.But three weeks after the new coronavirus emerged as a health crisis, experts can’t yet say whether these efforts will succeed at containing an infection that now threatens at least 15 countries.Some early signs are discouraging: Six countries, including China, have confirmed human-to-human transmission of the infection. Those include four cases in Germany connected to a single person — a worrisome sign for containment of the disease. Cases in China continue to multiply, and five million residents of Wuhan, where the virus originated, have left the city, some of them surely carrying the disease.But so far, the mortality rate is less than the rate of other severe respiratory coronaviruses. In China, where 5,974 people are infected, 132 have died through Tuesday. That is a high rate, but far less than the fatality rate of SARS and MERS. And countries like the United States that quickly began screening travelers, isolating sick people and tracing their contacts have just a handful of cases. There have been no fatalities outside China.Public health officials said Tuesday that they are grappling with a long list of unknowns that will determine how successful they are in limiting the toll of the widening outbreak. Those questions include how lethal the virus may be, how contagious it is, whether it is transmitted by people who are infected but show no symptoms, and whether it can be largely contained in its country of origin.“It is very striking how quickly the numbers are going up,” said Trish Perl, chief of infectious diseases and geographic medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center, who has fought other respiratory virus outbreaks, including SARS and MERS.“As the numbers are going up, do I think I’m concerned about the rapidity of it? Yes,” Perl said. “Do I think it may be difficult to control? Yes. But in the context of a lot of unknowns.”Experts are not sure whether the rise in new cases means the virus is now widely circulating in China, or whether the Chinese are doing a better job of surveillance and testing, or both.U.S. health officials held a news conference Tuesday to reassure a wary public that, for now, virtually no one here is in imminent danger.“Americans should know that this is a potentially very serious public health threat, but, at this point, Americans should not worry for their own safety,” said Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar.The new virus is not nearly as infectious as the measles virus, which can live as long as two hours in the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it is not comparable to the threat posed by the seasonal flu, which has killed at least 8,200 people in the United States so far this season.But Azar also acknowledged, “We don’t yet know everything we need to know about this virus.”China agreed Tuesday to allow a World Health Organization team of experts into the country to study the coronavirus, officials of the U.N. agency said after a meeting between the organization’s director general and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.“The two sides agreed that WHO will send international experts to visit China as soon as possible to work with Chinese counterparts on increasing understanding of the outbreak to guide global response efforts,” the statement said.It was unclear whether the team would include experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But several nations continued to pursue or consider evacuating their citizens from Wuhan, including France, South Korea, Morocco, Britain, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Russia.In the Philippines, immigration authorities temporarily suspended the issuance of visas for Chinese nationals upon arrival. Immigration commissioner Jaime Morente said the move was designed “to slow down the influx of group tours” and prevent the spread of the virus.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced dramatic measures to stem the flow of mainland Chinese into the territory, including the closure of railways, ferries and cross-border tour buses. Flights to mainland China will be slashed by half, and the Hong Kong government will stop issuing individual travel visas to mainland Chinese, starting Thursday.Yet for all the action taken, even the near future remains uncertain.“There is a real possibility that this virus will not be able to be contained,” said former CDC director Tom Frieden, who oversaw the responses to the Ebola and Zika outbreaks.Researchers are struggling to accurately model the outbreak and predict how it might unfold, in part because the data released by Chinese authorities is incomplete. China has shared information showing when cases were reported, but not when people became ill.Researchers also want to know more about the incubation period, currently estimated at two to 14 days, and how severe most cases are.The virus’s fatality rate is just over two percent, if figures posted by the Chinese government are accurate. That is considerably lower than death rates from the respiratory coronaviruses that caused SARS, which killed nearly 10 percent of people infected, and MERS, which killed about 35 percent.Some experts are encouraged that no case outside China seems to be severe. and that no fatalities have been recorded outside China so far.Others cautioned that the current death rate may mean little because the most severe cases in an epidemic like this one often emerge early, when sick people present themselves to health care providers, then become fewer as public health measures are instituted and medical care is strengthened.Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted in an interview that the virus may have been spreading unnoticed for weeks in Wuhan before it emerged into public view.If many people had mild symptoms, it would have been easy to miss them, and that made it harder to put control measures in place, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.Experts also are unsure whether asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus. China’s health minister Ma Xiaowei alarmed officials around the world this weekend when he said his government had evidence that this type of spread was occurring.But U.S. officials have challenged that conclusion, saying they have not seen data that prove it and want the Chinese to show them. And asymptomatic patients never drive more than a small percentage of infections in epidemics such as this one, Fauci said.“Even if there some asymptomatic transmission, in all the history of respiratory-borne viruses of any type, asymptomatic transmission has never been the driver of outbreaks,” he said. “The driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person.”Frieden and others emphasized that even if officials cannot stop transmission, they can still reduce the number of people who get infected, as well as those who get very sick and die. A critical measure, for example, is beefing up readiness by training health-care workers in hospitals to prevent the spread of illness.At the moment, U.S. officials are isolating coronavirus patients in the hospital. But that may not be practical if there are many more cases. During SARS, highly infectious patients known as “super spreaders” were responsible for the virus’s rapid spread in health-care facilities.It makes more sense to isolate someone with a mild coronavirus illness at home, said Nuzzo, the Hopkins expert. “If somebody only has a fever and runny nose, is there a need to freak out?” she said.",1
"New research has bolstered the hypothesis that summer’s heat, humidity, abundant sunshine and opportunities for people to get outside should combine to inhibit — though certainly not halt — the spread of the coronavirus.But infectious-disease experts add a cautionary note: Any benefit from summer conditions would probably be lost if people mistakenly believe the virus can’t spread in warm weather and abandon efforts that limit infections, such as social distancing.“The best way to think about weather is as a secondary factor here,” said Mohammad Jalali, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who has researched how weather affects the spread of viruses.The effect of weather on the coronavirus has been the subject of extensive research in recent months and is acutely relevant as the Northern Hemisphere edges closer to Memorial Day and the unofficial start of summer. States and cities are terminating or modifying shutdown orders, and millions of students trying to take classes remotely will soon see their disrupted school year come to an end.In this transitional moment, many people who have been in quarantine will probably find themselves in places — beaches, pools, parks, recreational sites — that historically have been viewed as benign but now carry some hard-to-calculate risk of viral transmission.Swimming in a chlorinated pool should be safe if people maintain the six-foot social distancing rule, according to new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC encouraged the use of facial coverings but cautioned they should not be worn in the water, because when wet they can make it difficult to breathe.“There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, spas, or water play areas. Proper operation and maintenance (including disinfection with chlorine and bromine) of these facilities should inactivate the virus in the water,” CDC spokeswoman Kate Grusich said in an email.But people can still transmit the virus through close personal interactions in any conditions, inside or outside, in sun or rain. The global picture reveals that the coronavirus is capable of spreading in any climate. Warm-weather countries, including Singapore, Indonesia, Brazil and Ecuador, are enduring significant viral spread.“Environmental conditions are just one more element of the equation, and not by far the most relevant. Covid-19 is spreading fiercely around the world, in all kinds of weather conditions,” Tomas Molina, the chief meteorologist at Spain’s Televisió de Catalunya and a professor at the University of Barcelona, said in an email. Molina examined the course of the outbreak in Barcelona and found a relationship between higher temperatures and lower virus transmission rates.
In recent weeks, numerous research studies, based on laboratory experiments, computer models and sophisticated statistical analyses, have supported the view that the coronavirus will be inhibited by summer weather.A new working paper and database put together by researchers at Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other institutions examines a host of weather conditions, from temperature and relative humidity to precipitation, at 3,739 locations worldwide to try to determine the “relative covid-19 risk due to weather.” They found that average temperatures above 77 degrees are associated with a reduction in the virus’s transmission.Each additional 1.8-degree temperature increase above that level was associated with an additional 3.1 percent reduction in the virus’s reproduction number, called R0, and pronounced “R naught.” That is the average number of new infections generated by each infected person. When the R0 drops below 1, an epidemic begins to wane, although it doesn’t happen overnight.However, like previous studies, the research from Harvard and MIT found that the transition to summer weather won’t be sufficient to completely contain the virus’s transmission.Other coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, have exhibited seasonality, ebbing during periods of warmer weather much like the seasonal flu. Many experts have suspected for months that the novel coronavirus might do the same.The seasonal factors in virus transmission work the other way around, too: A decline in transmission in summer would probably be followed by a seasonal increase in infections in the fall.There are many factors in the seasonal pattern. The virus degrades outside a host cell, and does so more rapidly when exposed to heat or ultraviolet radiation from the sun.Humidity plays a complex role. Research indicates that viruses easily spread in winter in the dry air of climate-controlled spaces. By contrast, higher humidity makes respiratory droplets, the most common vector of virus, drop to the ground or floor more quickly, limiting airborne transmission.Even in summer, most people live their lives indoors, and much of what happens this summer will pivot on how carefully people maintain social distancing and limit contact with other people. In communities that ease the shutdown restrictions, some people will return to office buildings and residences. Viral transmission has been common in confined spaces where people are in close contact.Another new study, from researchers at Princeton University and the National Institutes of Health, found that our lack of immunity to the coronavirus will overwhelm any tempering influence that warm, humid weather may have on the virus’s spread. Only in future years, if the virus transitions to an endemic illness that flares up in smaller outbreaks each year, will climate be a more important factor, the study found.Research published in recent days, looking at how human speech creates small respiratory droplets that can linger in the air for many minutes, has raised anew the question of how the virus spreads and whether some transmission is through these small aerosol droplets. That remains unresolved.David Rubin, director of PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and his colleagues have incorporated weather factors in the model they have developed showing when and where it will be relatively safe to ease some shutdown orders.“Clearly, I believe weather is impacting it — it’s just not impacting it enough to completely eliminate transmission,” Rubin said. “That’s why we’re still seeing cases in Florida and Texas and Tennessee. It seems to be preventing a big exponential rise in cases.”Multiple early studies provide evidence of statistical ties between temperature and humidity ranges and the geographic regions where this virus has thrived. While none of these studies has been conclusive, they all point to the same general possibility: The pandemic could ease in parts of North America and Europe during the summer months, although it could come roaring back in the fall.Rich Sorkin, co-founder of Jupiter Intelligence, a risk management company that is helping clients understand the effect of weather on the coronavirus, said, “There’s a certain element of geography-is-destiny here.” The countries with the largest outbreaks and highest mortality rates to date are all in cooler climates, he said.“There’s a strong pattern of weather characteristics influencing mortality,” he said. But he added that government policies and other aspects of the virus are also important.The Trump administration has touted laboratory studies, carried out at the U.S. Army’s high-level biosecurity laboratory at Fort Detrick, Md., as revealing the virus’s susceptibility to heat and sunlight. The results, revealed during an April 23 coronavirus task force news briefing, largely matched other laboratory studies and the suspicions of some researchers by showing that the novel coronavirus, like many other viruses, does not survive as long on certain surfaces and in the air when exposed to high amounts of ultraviolet light and warm and humid conditions.But David Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said laboratory studies on the coronavirus’s behavior under different weather conditions should be viewed with caution.“Laboratory studies are just that, and they’re not the real situation,” he said. “We still see it transmitting in most parts of the world, even in tropical areas.”Epidemiologists, Heymann said, are looking at what is happening in real settings, such as the clusters of cases in meatpacking plants and nursing homes, both of which are confined spaces with people in close contact. Laboratory studies, he said, should follow such observations to test how best to protect people in those settings, rather than having lab results lead directly to policies that may not reflect where and how people are getting sick in the real world.“That’s always been a disconnect between laboratories and epidemiologists,” he said.",1
"Ordinary speech can emit small respiratory droplets that linger in the air for at least eight minutes and potentially much longer, according to a study published Wednesday that could help explain why infections of the coronavirus so often cluster in nursing homes, households, conferences, cruise ships and other confined spaces with limited air circulation.The report, from researchers at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the University of Pennsylvania, was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed journal. It is based on an experiment that used laser light to study the number of small respiratory droplets emitted through human speech.The answer: a lot.“Highly sensitive laser light scattering observations have revealed that loud speech can emit thousands of oral fluid droplets per second,” the report states.Previous research has shown large outbreaks of coronavirus infections in a call center in South Korea where workers were in proximity and in a crowded restaurant in China, and such events have led some experts to suspect that the highly contagious virus can spread through small aerosol droplets. That remains the subject of research and debate, and for now, the consensus among infectious disease experts is the virus is typically spread through large respiratory droplets.This new study did not involve the coronavirus or any other virus, but instead looked at how people generate respiratory droplets when they speak. The experiment did not look at large droplets but instead focused on small droplets that can linger in the air much longer. These droplets still could potentially contain enough virus particles to represent an infectious dose, the authors said.Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.Louder speech produces more droplets, they note. The paper estimates that one minute of “loud speaking” generates “at least 1,000 virion-containing droplet nuclei that remain airborne” for more than eight minutes.“This direct visualization demonstrates how normal speech generates airborne droplets that can remain suspended for tens of minutes or longer and are eminently capable of transmitting disease in confined spaces,” the authors write.A video showing the laser experiment was circulating early last month through social media even as public health officials were weighing whether to recommend that people wear facial coverings. At the time, the National Institutes of Health cautioned that the research was “very preliminary” and should not be relied upon as a basis for public health measures.Soon thereafter, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended facial coverings in public places where social distancing could not easily be maintained.“This study is the most accurate measure of the size, number and frequency of droplets that leave the mouth during a normal conversation and shower any listeners within range,” said Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University-Texarkana who was not involved in the research.“This study doesn’t directly test whether the virus can be transmitted by talking, but it builds a strong circumstantial case that droplets produced in a normal close conversation would be large enough and frequent enough to create a high risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 or any other respiratory virus between people who are not wearing face masks,” Neuman said.“Speech creates droplets that breathing alone does not. That much is clear,” said Andrew Noymer, a University of California at Irvine epidemiologist who also was not part of the new research. “Big mouths of the world, beware. You’re putting the rest of us at risk.”",1
"Some reports predict that close to half the global population will eventually contract the coronavirus. While aggressive testing to contain the spread of the disease remains a top priority, scientists and researchers believe that an effective treatment can serve as a bridge while experts develop a vaccine.For now, regulators are heavily leaning toward repurposing existing medications, which will both save time and guarantee a steady supply. The Food and Drug Administration is looking into drugs that are normally used to treat other conditions, such as HIV, malaria, Ebola and rheumatoid arthritis, as possible candidates to treat Covid-19.It’s a process that will prove to be “a very, very difficult business,” according to Rena Conti, an associate markets professor at Boston University. “Four out of five drugs fail in developing. And that’s true for cancer and for other types of significant unmet needs that we have now. And that exact same failure rate should be expected in developing a treatment for Covid-19.”Other therapeutic treatments such as convalescent plasma therapy, which uses blood from recovered patients to treat those in critical condition, have recently come into the spotlight after the FDA approved its use on March 24. It’s a treatment that’s been around for over 100 years, most notably to combat other diseases such as the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. However, the challenge lies in proving its efficacy and securing enough plasma to treat those who are in need. Scientists remain hopeful, given the number of treatments and drugs that are under consideration. As of April 19, the FDA revealed that 72 treatments are in active trials and 211 treatments are in the planning stages. “I think it is likely that we will be able to identify a therapy that has some success within a period of several months to maybe a year,” said Andrew D. Badley, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic.",1
"Scientists around the globe are racing to develop tests, treatments and vaccines to combat the COVID-19 disease.Near term, tests are the priority. Beyond testing, regulators are trying to get treatments approved as quickly and safely as possible to serve as a bridge to a vaccine, which is likely to take 12 months, according to the U.S. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn.Health-care experts broadly agree that a treatment is likely to come before a vaccine. “If a good treatment emerges, whatever it is, we expect regulators to prioritize expeditious review,” Laura Sutcliffe, a UBS health-care analyst said in a research note. Treatments
U.S. regulators are leaning heavily on previously developed treatments. At a press conference with President Donald Trump, the FDA commissioner confirmed the agency is currently looking at drugs already approved for other diseases. Several therapies have been thrust into the spotlight in recent days for their promise: Gilead’s remdesivir, Regeneron’s kevzara and generic antimalarial drug chloroquine (and an alternative version called hydroxychloroquine).  
Remdesivir was developed by U.S. pharma giant Gilead Sciences Inc and was previously tried as a treatment for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another type of coronavirus, and Ebola. Remdesivir is currently in clinical trials and is also permitted for compassionate use  — meaning it can be used to treat a severely ill patient when no other treatments are available. The Credit Suisse pharma team note that this is the most advanced novel therapy, but they have concerns about supply. Biotech giant Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is trialing its drug kevzara for use against COVID-19. It is currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Regeneron co-developed the drug with French health-care firm Sanofi. Chloroquine is a generic malaria drug which has shown promise as a treatment against COVID-19. German biosciences conglomerate, Bayer, announced Tuesday it has donated 3 million tablets of its malaria drug resochin which is made of chloroquine phosphate, to the U.S. government to aid in the fight against the virus.  
The Credit Suisse pharma team see manufacturing and supply as the key challenge for the majority of proposed COVID-19 therapies and, in due course, vaccines: “A global pandemic requires a huge volume of drug in a very short space of time. Stocks of legacy drugs, new drug candidates will take months to build, in our view.” Vaccines.Usually vaccine development takes more than five years and requires significant capital investment. This lengthy process has created problems in the past, for example with Ebola. But the scientific community is better prepared now than it was for Ebola, argues Sutcliff. A body was set up to coordinate developing vaccines for pandemics and researchers can now leverage work done during previous outbreaks to propel them forward.While meaningful progress has been made in recent weeks, in particular from biotech firms specializing in mRNA molecules (these are used to instruct the body to produce its own response to fight a range of diseases) like Moderna and BioNtech, this approach has been more successful in veterinary medicine than in humans. There is no guarantee they will be successful. In parallel to the work being done by these biotech firms, traditional pharma giants like GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi are leaning on their experience dealing with seasonal flu to try to come up with an immunization. But even then, there is no guarantee of success.  Testing 
Several countries, in particular the U.S. and the U.K. are facing heavy criticism from health-care experts over testing. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday the U.K. is in negotiations to buy hundreds of thousands of tests which would be able to detect whether someone has had COVID-19 by checking the presence of antibodies. He argued this could turn the tide in the fight against the virus.  A continuous process. Health-care companies and regulators have a fine balancing act to maintain: They must race against the clock to get effective treatments and vaccines to market, but they must also ensure those treatments do not have negative effects on patients. That requires rigorous and time-intensive clinical trials. This is a continuous process and every aspect of the solution matters — from testing to treatment to immunization.",1
"The science is fast, but the virus is faster. In a suburb south of Boston, robots have already started manufacturing a potential vaccine against the fast-spreading coronavirus. Another candidate vaccine — developed when a similar virus terrified the world — sits in deep freeze in a repository in Houston, ready to be thawed and formulated into thousands of vials for further testing. Yet another is being put together at facilities in San Diego and Houston, with projections that it could be tested in people by summer.To scientists, the work to create a vaccine against the new coronavirus is advancing with a speed they could barely have imagined a decade ago. At the same time, it’s not even close to quick enough to contain the spreading infection — and in many ways, the outbreak will test the capacity of science to react in real time to a new and unknown “pathogen X” that takes the world by surprise.“Traditional vaccine development efforts have usually taken decades, not months,” said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health, which hopes to have a vaccine in human testing by April. “This is, first, a response to this new virus, but it’s also a drill for pathogen X … [to] press the system, to see how rapidly we can go.”When a mysterious new illness emerges and public alarm is at its peak, there’s a race to develop a way to prevent or treat the disease. But by the time a promising candidate is ready, it’s often too late to be helpful against the outbreak that triggered the rush. Public interest, funding and the urgency that drove the early vaccine development can quickly taper.“We were getting candidate vaccines, the epidemics would die down, and they’d get put back on the shelf,” said Jacqueline Shea, chief scientific officer of Inovio, a biotech company that has been developing vaccines for Zika, Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome.That’s what happened with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), to the dismay of Peter Jay Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. Eight years ago, he and his co-director, Maria Elena Bottazzi, won federal funding to create a vaccine against SARS, a coronavirus that emerged in 2002 and infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800. By 2016, they had manufactured enough of the potential vaccine to get through toxicology tests and human safety trials.But the team tried and failed to win various grants to bring their experimental vaccine through further testing. They say about $2 million could have funded essential and time-consuming toxicology studies and ready it for phase 1 trials — the technical term for the first-in-humans studies that typically determine the dosing and safety of a drug. Although the threat of SARS has receded, it was becoming increasingly clear that coronaviruses, long thought to cause mild illness, were able to cause serious pandemics.When the new coronavirus genome sequence was posted to an online genetic databank in early January, Hotez immediately saw the close similarity to SARS and realized the samples sitting in storage had the potential to defend against the new virus.“Had we been able to secure the investment, we could have done all the phase 1 trials. We could have potentially been ready to vaccinate in China, now,” Hotez said. “This is the problem with the whole vaccine infrastructure — it’s reactive, not anticipatory enough. ‘Oh, SARS is gone now, let’s move on.’”What the scientific response to the new coronavirus has shown so far is how the first step in the process — designing and even beginning to manufacture the vaccine — can happen nearly overnight, thanks to the emergence of new technologies.Scientists at the National Institutes of Health were strategizing with a Massachusetts biotech company, Moderna, over the winter holiday break about collaborating to build a vaccine for the virus. As soon as the genome of the virus was posted online, NIH designed the piece of the vaccine that should trigger the immune system to recognize and disable the virus. NIH sent its design to Moderna, which could integrate it into its virus platform and rapidly scale up manufacturing. NIH hopes to have the vaccine in the first safety trials by April.At Inovio, a biotech company headquartered outside Philadelphia, a team began working on designing a vaccine hours after the sequence appeared, Shea said. The company farmed out production of one piece of its vaccine to a contract laboratory in Houston and is making the other component at its facility in San Diego. The company is gearing up for the lab and animal tests that will be necessary before safety trials in people.Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has also jumped into the vaccine effort and estimates it will be eight to 12 months before its candidate is ready for testing in people. Many countries are also working on different approaches, in parallel.“The actual technical feat of making a vaccine against this virus is probably not going to be that hard,” Hotez said. “The problem is you can’t avoid or even compress the timelines very much for safety testing.”That means scientists are flooded with public interest in their vaccine efforts right now and must temper their excitement with the reality that there will be a months-long wait, at minimum, for a vaccine that’s ready for its first tests in people.“What is the value of a vaccine if development takes a year in the context of the current situation, which seems to be moving very rapidly? The value of a vaccine is we don’t actually know what the trajectory of the epidemic could be,” said Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a global alliance that is funding the Inovio and Moderna efforts and another vaccine being created by researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia.For example, if the outbreak is still raging after initial safety tests, it is possible experimental vaccines could be used to protect people on the front lines of treating the disease or in emergency situations before they are approved for the general population, as happened with Ebola. When Ebola devastated West Africa in 2014, a vaccine was not ready. But when the virus resurfaced in 2019 in Congo, more than 200,000 people were vaccinated.If the infections have begun to subside by the time vaccines are through the first round of safety testing, getting a vaccine approved would still be useful in case the virus flares again — but showing it is safe for healthy people in the general population will take time and continued effort.In the meantime, researchers are also looking at ways of quickly repurposing existing antiviral drugs to see whether any might work against the coronavirus. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer of Johnson & Johnson, said the company has donated 100 boxes of an HIV medication, Prezcobix, to clinicians in Shanghai to see whether it showed any efficacy against the illness. Purdue University researchers hope to test experimental drugs that were initially developed to fight SARS. At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, researchers have been gearing up to test remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug that has shown promise against other coronaviruses but failed against Ebola.But every step takes time. Even having the right laboratory tests, ingredients and animal models of the disease are crucial and time-consuming steps. Laboratories have been waiting for the viral genome to be synthesized by companies and are anxious to get samples of the actual virus.A decade after SARS, another coronavirus emerged that caused Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Many say the coronavirus in China is a lesson that this family of viruses will continue to cross from animals into humans and cause potential pandemics. That means scientists would like to be prepared, with vaccine platforms that can be readily adapted to new infections and antiviral drugs that work broadly for multiple diseases.“Emerging viruses, they’re a moving target. They come, and they go, and sometimes they come and they don’t go. But it’s impossible to predict the trajectory of an emerging virus,” said Timothy Sheahan, assistant professor at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina. “So one way we’re trying to maximize the utility of a given antiviral drug is to develop broad-spectrum antivirals. Rather than have one drug for one bug, we want one drug for many bugs.”",1
"The disease caused by a new virus that emerged late last year in China and has since sickened tens of thousands of people now has an official name: COVID-19.
At a press briefing on Tuesday, the World Health Organization said it had decided on the name after consulting with the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health.“We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual, or group of people,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. WHO also wanted a name that was “pronounceable and related to the disease,” he said.",1
"The question was posed bluntly to the nearly 100,000 members of a Facebook group devoted to ending Pennsylvania’s stay-at-home orders, with a user writing, “if there was a vaccine for coronavirus would you be likely to take it.”“Absolutely not.”“No.”“Never.”The resoundingly negative answers streamed forth, generating 1,700 comments and providing a window into brewing resistance to a potential coronavirus vaccine that experts say offers the surest path back to normal life.Some of the same online activists who have clamored to resume economic activity, echoing President Trump’s call to “liberate” their states from sweeping restrictions, are now aligning themselves with a cause on the political fringe — preemptively forswearing a vaccine. To further their baseless claims about the dangers of vaccines and to portray the scientific process as reckless, they have seized on the brisk pace promised for the project, which the Trump administration has branded “Operation Warp Speed.”“We’re looking to get it by the end of the year if we can,” the president said Friday.Both movements represent the views of a small minority of Americans. But leading medical experts fear that the ability of their adherents to spread misinformation online could plant seeds of confusion and distrust in the broader public — and undermine future efforts to distribute a vaccine.Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he has grown increasingly concerned that the name of the initiative has led to misconceptions about what is being put at risk by speeding up the effort — only financial investments, not safety or efficacy.“People don’t understand that, because when they hear ‘Operation Warp Speed,’ they think, ‘Oh, my God, they’re jumping over all these steps and they’re going to put us at risk,’ ” Fauci said in an interview Wednesday with The Washington Post.No steps would be eliminated, he vowed. Rather, multiple steps — from collecting data to preparing to scale up the number of potential doses — would be pursued at once, creating “risk for the investment” but not for the patient or the “integrity of the study.”“You’re doing things in a totally unprecedented way, and you’re going really fast but not compromising safety because you haven’t cut out any of the steps you would have done had you done it the traditional way,” Fauci said.But such guardrails have gone unmentioned on some of the most active platforms for coordinating opposition to measures designed to slow the spread of the virus. One participant in a 2,000-member reopening group on Facebook suggested Trump was “pandering to the left” by speeding a vaccine to market. Another, addressing more than 26,000 fellow users, called the effort “mad,” linking to a video outlining a conspiracy theory about Bill Gates.The views, though they reflect an extreme position, are a sign of looming obstacles to public trust for the Trump administration and governments around the world rushing to complete a process in a matter of months that typically takes years. In a Yahoo News-YouGov poll this month, nearly 1 in 5 Americans said they would not take a coronavirus vaccine.
The online activity illustrates how anti-vaccine stalwarts have found common cause with those protesting stay-at-home measures, flocking to their demonstrations and staging their own. The two movements are also drawing on a common online organizing infrastructure, increasingly merging in the fluid corners of Facebook.
Their groups and pages, which frequently boast followings in the six figures, easily swap out one target of perceived government overreach for another, in an early sign of how misinformation could thwart efforts to immunize the public from a disease that has killed 90,000 Americans.Matthew Ferrari, an epidemiologist at Pennsylvania State University, said there were already indications that anti-science sentiment flaring in the early days of the pandemic could be “eroding confidence in existing vaccines.”A study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that vaccination rates for children in Michigan fell steeply in May, including to fewer than half of infants 5 months or younger. Reduced access to immunizations could have been a result of the stay-at-home order designed to contain the outbreak, the report noted, though the state order halting elective procedures did not specifically include vaccinations.The decline in up-to-date status for recommended vaccines threatens herd immunity against highly contagious infectious diseases such as measles, the CDC warned. Ensuring the interruption does not become permanent is a priority, Ferrari said, requiring clear science communication.Peter J. Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said his initial modeling suggests “a significant number of Americans” will need to be vaccinated against the coronavirus to interrupt transmission.“I’m worried that the anti-vaccine movement is going to be so strengthened to the point where we won’t have those numbers, and part of this may just be people opting out because of mixed messaging,” he said. “You’d think the anti-vaccine movement would go into retreat with everyone wanting a vaccine, but it’s been energized over ‘Operation Warp Speed’ and over biotech and pharma companies sending out irresponsible press releases.”The central tenets of the anti-vaccine movement, Hotez said, are that vaccines cause autism, which they do not, and, “second, that vaccines are rushed, third that they’re not adequately tested for safety and fourth that there’s an alliance between the federal government and the pharmaceutical companies.”“This ‘Operation Warp Speed’ plays right into three of those four things, and there’s been no attempt to refute that messaging,” he said.Michael Caputo, a longtime Trump adviser tapped to lead communications for the initiative as the freshly minted head of public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services, said he was responsible for the branding. He drew the name “Operation Warp Speed” from the terminology scientists were already using internally to describe their efforts, he said, after initially toying with names from Greek and Roman mythology but struggling to find a fitting title.
Of efforts to paint the process as overly hasty, Caputo said, “This is a concern that everyone in the operation is taking to heart.” A White House spokesman declined to comment.The protests against a possible vaccine extend far beyond the group focused on Pennsylvania. A similar question appeared in a Facebook group dedicated to reopening Arizona, where a user suggested that resisting a vaccine was a reason “to keep this Facebook group strong and going,” even as states begin to lift their stay-at-home orders. “Will you take it?” she asked. Among answers spouting debunked theories about the dangers of vaccines, one user weighed in to say she was newly skeptical, in light of how the development process was proceeding.“Although I have been vaccinated myself and vaccinated my kids for the typical childhood diseases (and have no issue with that) the thought of a vaccine being rushed through trial and forced on us makes me very nervous,” she wrote.
On Twitter, more than three-quarters of posts since Monday using the hashtag #OperationWarpSpeed have pushed conspiracy theories about the effort. Others suggested hydroxychloroquine was a more suitable option, even though the Food and Drug Administration has warned of the antimalarial drug’s possible side effects. Trump on Monday said he was taking the drug as a preventive measure, prompting some of his supporters to double down on the unproven drug, which has been linked to increased risk of death for certain patients.“I would take Trump’s hydroxychloroquine . . . before I would be vaccinated by the left’s new covid-19 vaccine!” read a meme posted Tuesday in a pro-Trump Facebook group with more than 82,000 members.Brad Parscale, who is managing the president’s reelection campaign, also touted the drug after the president’s revelation about taking it. On Twitter, he shared a news release from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a right-wing group that has lobbied in favor of broader exemptions from inoculation requirements for religious and other beliefs. Its periodical has published reports 0ly tying child vaccination to autism and advancing a discredited link between abortion and breast cancer.A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Jane M. Orient, the group’s executive director, said AAPS contends that “vaccines should be fully tested and voluntary.”Similar views animate an online petition against a mandatory coronavirus vaccine sponsored by LifeSiteNews, a right-wing website that the fact-checking website Snopes calls a “known purveyor of misleading information.” The petition, which has racked up nearly half a million signatures, has been posted in some of the largest “reopen” groups on Facebook.Hotez said the activity showed Facebook is not doing enough to weed out dangerous misinformation putting public health at risk.Changes introduced by the technology giant last year were aimed at surfacing authoritative content about vaccines, including by altering what sort of pages and groups appear in the News Feed and search features. Andrea Vallone, a Facebook spokeswoman, pointed to a March news release from Nick Clegg, the company’s vice president for global affairs and communications, saying, “We remove COVID-19 related misinformation that could contribute to imminent physical harm.”
Misinformation about vaccines is still rampant on the platform, said Kolina Koltai, a postdoctoral scholar at the Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington who has been studying anti-vaccine groups on Facebook for five years. She first learned about the coronavirus in January, she said, because the online communities she tracks were already portraying the outbreak as a tool of government control.The conspiracy theories that sow distrust of immunization rely on some well-founded concerns about profit and the role of industry, she said.Moncef Slaoui, a former Moderna executive tapped to lead the White House’s vaccine initiative, on Tuesday divested his stock options in the Massachusetts biotechnology company, which a day earlier had announced promising early results from its first human safety tests. Moderna did not respond to a request for comment.“The anti-vaccine movement is really good at drawing people in,” Koltai said. “They’ll use whatever half-truth or slogan they can to convince people of their conspiracy beliefs.”",1
"It would be reckless to simply dismiss the concerns of frightened parents.Central to our hope of returning to life as normal is the possibility of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that is causing covid-19. Dozens of companies have announced innovative development plans, and the White House has called for relaxed regulations that would expedite testing and approval.It seems as if everyone would be on board: a simple intervention to prevent future infection, protect those who are most vulnerable and allow us to move freely once again, all without significant side effects. Yet the race for a vaccine and the techniques being used to manufacture it are bound to activate some familiar fears. In particular, those who worry about “unnatural” medical interventions may fear the vaccine more than the pandemic it’s designed to stop. If we don’t learn from past mistakes and funnel resources into education and outreach, the process could backfire, magnifying distrust of vaccines and making widespread immunity harder to achieve.There are many players in the current vaccine development race, using several different techniques. Among them are biotechnology companies, relatively new to vaccine development, that are using novel technologies that do not employ the traditional approach of culturing and attenuating a live virus. The first vaccine approved for clinical trials in Germany aims to deliver an engineered synthetic gene that will allow the body to recognize an antigen and build an immune response without risk of illness. The hope is that such vaccines could be administered in smaller doses, facilitating quicker delivery to more people even with relatively limited manufacturing capabilities. Meanwhile, at Oxford’s Jenner Institute, researchers have begun human testing of a vaccine made by genetically modifying a common cold virus to produce proteins from the virus that causes covid-19, causing it to trigger an immune response.The trouble — at least where public perception is concerned — may begin with the vexing terms “synthetic” and “modified.” Consumers draw strong distinctions between natural and artificial. This is most obvious in the food industry, where non-GMO and natural branding command outsize influence. Overcoming the stigma of “artificial” or “synthetic” is also proving to be a problem for so-called “cultured” meat. Yet rejection of high-tech foods is a symptom of a broader preference for the natural and fear of the “unnatural,” which has featured in historical objections to everything from in vitro fertilization to cloning animals.Troublingly, the natural/unnatural binary is a powerful paradigm for parents who reject some or all vaccines. Such parents tend to emphasize natural living and see man-made inventions as intrinsically inferior and potentially dangerous. The movement led by actress Jenny McCarthy to “Green the Vaccine” focuses specifically on the ingredients in vaccines. As she told a crowd of supporters: “This is not an anti-vaccine rally. This is not an anti-vaccine group. … What we are saying is that the number of vaccines given and the ingredients, like the freaking mercury, the ether, the aluminum, the antifreeze, need to be removed immediately.” (Antifreeze is not used in vaccines.) McCarthy’s is a position that allows one to be theoretically open to vaccines, while opposing the unnatural chemicals that are inevitably in them, as in this characteristic tweet: “The reason why I’m most likely against [a vaccine] is because beside the pathogen, there are 100 or more chemicals and preservatives which outcome [sic] the advantages of vaccines. Almost anything unnatural to your body is bad.”These are the critiques that have long been leveled at vaccines produced by more traditional means. If new vaccines are seemingly less “natural” and rely on synthetic genetic material or genetic modification, their perceived artificiality is likely to heighten concerns. It could also exacerbate the widespread misconception that vaccine-derived immunity is inferior to “natural” immunity derived from infection and recovery. As one parent put it an interview, comparing immunity resulting from vaccines with “natural” immunity resulting from infection: “A vaccine’s never gonna do better than [what] my body can produce if my body’s healthy enough to produce, so that’s what we went with.”Misguided as such ideas are, it would be reckless to dismiss parents’ concerns as foolish or ignorant. It would also be reckless to continue to develop a vaccine without significant investment in public outreach. Not everyone who rejects vaccines is a conspiracy theorist: Some are just under the spell of the natural/unnatural binary, which has also captured everyone from fans of LaCroix seltzer to devotees of Gwyneth Paltrow’s wellness brand. Moreover, pharmaceutical companies and tech companies have squandered our trust, failing to be transparent about their product development, testing procedures and safety measures, which has resulted in marketing of ineffective drugs and patient harm. Given all of this, a vaccine produced by untrusted actors using synthetic genetic material and rushed to production runs a very high risk of provoking resistance.Fortunately, there are established ways to mitigate that risk. Social distancing for polio in years past resembles our response to covid-19. Uncertainty and fear were equally common, and there was also a race for a vaccine. Yet as groups like the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis — later the March of Dimes and an early example of crowdsourced science — raised funds for a vaccine, they communicated clearly and effectively to the public. So clearly and effectively, in fact, that a 1954 Gallup poll shows that more people knew about the polio vaccine field trials than knew the name of the president.Today, trust in the medical establishment is notably lower than it was decades ago. Public perception of pharmaceutical companies has been clouded, understandably, by exposes of widespread corruption, profiteering and manipulation of the kind that led to the opioid crisis. That makes it imperative for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine researchers in the United States and abroad, as well as government agencies and health care providers, to emphasize transparency, clarity and reassurance about vaccine science — including the way vaccines work in the body and what steps were abbreviated in what will surely be an expedited review process.Long lists of side effects in fine print and newspaper articles laden with technical jargon are not enough. An essential part of transparency is ensuring that explanations are easily accessible and widely distributed through active outreach. Supply chains and manufacturing standards, often opaque, must also be made painstakingly clear. This is especially important given the global nature of vaccine development and production, which includes countries with different standards of transparency and regulation.Overcoming the natural/unnatural binary is a good place to start. Pediatricians are already increasingly working to describe vaccines as a technology that allows the “body’s natural immune response to create protections” and stimulate a “natural reaction.” “Immunize for Good,” a Colorado vaccine advocacy campaign, has adopted similar rhetoric to reassure the public, explaining that “Vaccines cause a natural immune response in the body without causing illness. … Our bodies recognize these weakened invaders and create antibodies to protect us against future infection. In this way, we trick our bodies into thinking we’ve already had the disease.” In other words, they emphasize how the end result is not only safe, but also natural.Those who frame the vaccine in this way do so because they have listened to people’s concerns, and that’s what we should be doing right now. Vaccine development ought to be conducted with the continual feedback of laypeople, upon whose willingness to vaccinate our general health depends. That means anticipating new concerns and empowering the public by soliciting their input on how to communicate about them.",1
"Bill Gates says the U.S. government is falling short in preparing the nation and the world for the “significant probability of a large and lethal modern-day pandemic occurring in our lifetimes.”In an interview this week, the billionaire philanthropist said he has raised the issue of pandemic preparedness with President Trump since the 2016 presidential election. In his most recent meeting last month, Gates said he laid out the increasing risk of a bioterrorism attack and stressed the importance of U.S. funding for advanced research on new therapeutics, including a universal flu vaccine, which would protect against all or most strains of influenza.Gates, who co-founded Microsoft and now leads a foundation on global health, said he told Trump that the president has a chance to lead on the issue of global health security. Trump encouraged him to follow up with top officials at the Health and Human Services Department, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, Gates said.Gates said he met several times with H.R. McMaster, the president’s former national security adviser, and hopes to meet with McMaster’s replacement, John Bolton. The National Security Council, Gates said, is an appropriate office to “show leadership on this issue and decide how to coordinate the various groups” within the government.“But, you know, I think we’ve got to push this ... with the executive branch and Congress quite a bit,” Gates said. “There hasn’t been a big effort along these lines.”His interview with The Washington Post preceded a speech — on the challenges associated with modern epidemics — that Gates gave Friday before the Massachusetts Medical Society.Gates and his wife, Melinda, have repeatedly warned that a pandemic is the greatest immediate threat to humanity. Experts say the risk is high, because new pathogens are constantly emerging and the world is so interconnected.Many experts agree that the United States remains underprepared for a pandemic or a bioterrorism threat. The government’s sprawling bureaucracy, they say, is not nimble enough to deal with mutations that suddenly turn an influenza virus into a particularly virulent strain, as the 1918 influenza did in killing an estimated 50 million to 100 million people worldwide.Even this winter’s harsh seasonal flu was enough to overwhelm some hospitals, forcing them to pitch tents outside emergency rooms to cope with the crush of patients.If a highly contagious and lethal airborne pathogen like the 1918 influenza were to take hold today, nearly 33 million people worldwide would die in just six months, Gates noted in his prepared remarks, citing a simulation done by the Institute for Disease Modeling, a research organization in Bellevue, Wash.In those remarks, Gates highlighted scientific and technical advances in the development of better vaccines, drugs and diagnostics that he said could revolutionize preparation for and treatment of infectious diseases. He praised last year’s formation of a new global coalition, known as CEPI, to create new vaccines for emerging infectious diseases. He also announced a $12 million Grand Challenge in partnership with the family of Google Inc. co-founder Larry Page to accelerate the development of a universal flu vaccine.But vaccines, he noted, take time to research, deploy and generate protective immunity.“So we need to invest in other approaches, like antiviral drugs and antibody therapies that can be stockpiled or rapidly manufactured to stop the spread of pandemic diseases or treat people who have been exposed,” he said in his speech.Among the advances in these areas are a new influenza antiviral recently approved in Japan that Gates said “stops the virus in its tracks” by inhibiting an enzyme it needs to multiply; research on antibodies that could protect against a pandemic strain of a virus; and a diagnostic test that harnesses the powerful genetic-engineering technology known as CRISPR and has the field-use potential to check a patient’s blood, saliva or urine for evidence of multiple pathogens. That test could, for example, identify whether someone is infected with Zika or dengue virus, which have similar symptoms.But even the best tools in the world won’t be sufficient, Gates said, if the United States doesn’t have a strategy to harness and coordinate resources at home and help to lead an effective global preparedness and response system.Trump and senior administration officials have affirmed the importance of controlling infectious disease outbreaks. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is facing a loss of emergency funding provided in the wake of the 2014 Ebola epidemic and has begun to planning to downsize its epidemic-prevention activities in 39 out of 49 countries where disease risks are greatest.Congress provided additional funding in last month’s spending bill. But it also directed the administration to come up with a comprehensive plan to strengthen global health security at home and abroad.“This could be an important first step if the White House and Congress use the opportunity to articulate and embrace a leadership role for the U.S.,” Gates said in the speech.No other country, he noted, has the depth of scientific or technical expertise that the United States possesses, drawing on the resources of institutions such as NIH, CDC and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, as well as the Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.",1
"As cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, rapidly increase in the United States and other parts of the world, epidemiologists and other researchers are urgently trying to learn more about the pathogen involved. One question that some virus specialists, and some meteorologists, are asking is whether there may be a seasonal aspect to this outbreak.In other words, is this more like the flu, which has a distinct winter peak in the United States and Europe and then ebbs for the spring and summer? Or is this here to stay at a high level of spread throughout the warm season?A new study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, shows that the novel coronavirus has been spreading most readily along an east-west band of the globe where the average temperatures are between 41 and 52 degrees and average humidity levels are between about 50 and 80 percent.The study, by researchers at the University of Maryland’s School of Medicine and in the Middle East, hypothesizes that the most at-risk cities in the coming weeks could lie just north of the region that has been most heavily affected to date as milder temperatures gradually move north.However, that assumes that the correlation with weather does in fact reveal something fundamental about the new coronavirus’s transmission, which is highly uncertain.“Although the current correlations with latitude and temperature seem strong, a direct causation has not been proven and predictions in the near-term are speculative and have to be considered with extreme caution,” the paper states.Mohammad Sajadi, a study co-author and a professor at the University of Maryland’s Institute of Human Virology, said the hypothesis that this virus exhibits a seasonality is based in part on the behavior of other respiratory viruses in temperate climates, as well as the lack of major covid-19 outbreaks in countries south of China, where travel patterns suggested the potential for large-scale spread.“Any time you’re dealing with a transmission event, there can be many potential variables, but sometimes one or [a] few variables are key,” Sajadi said via email. “We hypothesize that average temperature is one of them. The main takeaway from the study, and the reason we are disclosing it early, is that, if validated by the scientific community, it would be potentially useful in ongoing surveillance efforts.”Judging by how the virus may have responded to temperatures so far, the study suggests areas just north of its current zone may be most vulnerable through April, including over the Midwest and Northeast United States, Central Asia, Eastern and Central Europe, and the British Isles. After that, it may find more of a foothold farther north in less-populated areas.However, the study does not take into account other factors that could be affecting the spread of the virus, such as climate variables beyond average temperature and humidity, including sunlight, as well as human behavior, population density, policy interventions to halt the spread of the virus and characteristics of the virus itself.Separately, Jupiter, a company that predicts risks from severe weather and climate change, has been analyzing transmission rates of the coronavirus in recent weeks and trying to find relationships with temperature. Jupiter chief executive Rich Sorkin has found some evidence that transmission rates are highest in countries with recent maximum temperatures below 68 degrees.Outside of China, all countries with high daily growth rates of the virus, above 50 percent (compounded over the past five days), had maximum temperatures below 68 degrees, Sorkin said. Of 18 countries that had substantially lower growth rates, between 0 and 20 percent, most (14) had maximum temperatures above 68 degrees.Sorkin cautioned that growth rates, however, were probably influenced by multiple factors, not just temperature, including importation of cases from infected countries, public health policies and infrastructure.Epidemiologists urge extreme caution: This virus may be with us throughout the warm season. Epidemiologists warn that so little is known about this coronavirus that it’s impossible to predict the course of the epidemic on the basis of weather or climate factors alone, and in fact, available evidence suggests that the virus can spread easily in warmer climates, such as Singapore’s.David Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said there are two main reasons the coronavirus could exhibit some seasonality. One has more to do with human behavior, because people tend not to be in confined spaces for extended periods during the summer. This could somewhat hinder the spread of the virus.The other reason, which is more of an unknown right now, has to do with the virus itself, specifically its transmissibility in different seasons.“No one knows” the transmission characteristics of this virus, Heymann said in an interview. “Certainly out here in Singapore, it transmits without any problem.” Singapore has had active community spread of the virus, but the government implemented policies including social distancing to stem the outbreak, with apparent success.Heymann said no one has yet shown a seasonality to the coronavirus that is due to characteristics of the virus itself.Studies have shown that the common flu virus has a seasonal aspect in the northern mid-latitudes, tied to humidity levels and temperature, among a number of variables. However, Heymann said that does not mean the spread of the novel coronavirus also will decline by early summer.“The one thing that’s clear is that this, at present, is not showing the same characteristics of influenza,” he said. In general, however, Heymann said, respiratory infections do tend to decline in the summer, but that there has not been a proven seasonality involved with two other major coronaviruses: SARS and MERS.

In a preprint of a study published on the medRxiv website that is pending peer review, a group of researchers, including the epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch of Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, examined the coronavirus outbreak when it was mostly limited to China. They found that it exhibited the potential for sustained transmission and exponential growth rates across a range of temperature and humidity levels in China, from tropical areas to cold and dry sections.
Coronavirus may have a seasonal cycle, but that doesn’t mean it will go away this summer, experts warn. Seasonality, explained: What warm weather could mean for the novel coronavirus.President Trump has said warm weather could slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, but experts explain it's too early to know if the virus is seasonal.

They found that it exhibited the potential for sustained transmission and exponential growth rates across a range of temperature and humidity levels in China, from tropical areas to cold and dry sections.
“Our results suggest that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions,” the study concludes.
Jeffrey Shaman, the director of the climate and health program at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, said that the novel coronavirus may exhibit a seasonality but that this is far from clear.“Given that it is a newly emerged virus to which most of the world is susceptible, I don’t think it will abate in April. Rather, it might ramp down in the U.S. in late May or June,” he said via email. “A similar pattern has been observed with pandemic influenza. Due to high susceptibility, the pandemic virus continues to circulate through late May or June, is limited in summer, and ramps up again in September.”But whether this new coronavirus exhibits such seasonality is far from guaranteed, Shaman said. “It may just continue through summer unabated,” he said.",1
"A preliminary report posted online claimed that a mutation had made the virus more transmissible. Geneticists say the evidence isn’t there.All viruses mutate, and the coronavirus is no exception. But there is no compelling evidence yet that it is evolving in a way that has made it more contagious or more deadly.
A preprint study — posted online, but not published in a scientific journal and not yet peer-reviewed — has set the internet afire by suggesting otherwise.
On April 30, a report by a team led by Bette Korber, a biologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, claimed to have found a mutation in the coronavirus that arose in Europe in February and then rapidly spread, becoming dominant as the virus was introduced into new countries.The mutation, they wrote, “is of urgent concern,” because it made the coronavirus more transmissible. Following media coverage, the prospect of a turbocharged strain hopscotching around the world has unnerved many people who already had enough on their minds.But experts in viral evolution are far from convinced. For one thing, there is no new strain: Unlike the flu, the coronavirus so far has not split into clearly distinct forms.It does mutate, but that’s what viruses do. Just because a mutation becomes more common isn’t proof that it is altering how the virus functions.Dr. Korber did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.Mutations are tiny changes to genetic material that occur as it is copied. Human cells have many so-called proofreading proteins that keep mutations rare. Still, each baby arrives with dozens of new genetic mutations.Viruses are far sloppier, producing many mutants every time they infect a cell. Many of these mutations aren’t useful to the virus, disabling it rather than helping it proliferate. A few may be beneficial to the virus. The rest have little effect one way or the other.Natural selection can favor viruses carrying a beneficial mutation, leading it to spread more widely. But it’s also possible for a neutral mutation to become more common simply by chance, a process known as genetic drift.“I don’t think they provide evidence to claim transmissibility enhancement,” Sergei Pond, an evolutionary biologist at Temple University, said of the new report in an email. “In order to establish this, you’d need direct competition between strains in the same geographic area.”Dr. Pond said you might also expect such a powerful mutation to arise in many different viruses and give their descendants an evolutionary edge. But that hasn’t happened.Some researchers took to Twitter to critique the paper. “I think those claims are suspect, to say the least,” wrote Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.“They got a bit over their skis on title, conclusions,” wrote Brian Wasik, an evolutionary biologist at Cornell University. “They deserve a strong and good-faith peer review.”None of the critics ruled out the possibility that a mutation could arise that would make the virus more transmissible. And it’s possible that D614G has provided some sort of edge.But it will take much more evidence to rule out other explanations.",1
"For many people living with the crushing consequences of Covid-19, the summer offers a tantalizing possibility: If the coronavirus behaves like the seasonal flu, warm weather could substantially weaken the virus and allow normal life to resume. President Trump predicted exactly this outcome in February, claiming the virus would “miraculously” go away by April as temperatures rose.A new working paper tries to put that speculation to rest by tracking how weather and other environmental conditions, such as pollution, affect the virus’s spread around the world.The forecast from researchers is grim: Warm weather alone will not control the virus in America or abroad. Here are the results for the United States, showing weather on its own cannot meaningfully reduce infections to the rate of 1 new case per every infected person, the point by which the number of infections falls continuously.Without social distancing and other interventions, summer will offer only a modest respite in some places, meaning stay-at-home orders and other government interventions will most likely need to continue throughout the summer.“At the end of the day, this whole effect from weather and pollution is still pretty minor,” said Mohammad Jalali, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and one of the study’s authors. “No government should rely on the effect of the weather.”The study, conducted by researchers at six academic institutions, found that warm weather could play a small role in slowing the virus in at least a few places and for a few months. In some of the hottest cities in the United States, like Phoenix, high temperatures could drive down the rate of infections by over 40 percent. In parts of India and Pakistan, conditions during the hotter months could make the virus less than half as likely to infect new hosts.
For regions facing cold, bitter winters, weather has the opposite effect, increasing the rate of infections and making it even harder to control the virus.
Like all weather forecasts, there is significant uncertainty about the results. Researchers will continue to debate the measurements and methodology; others may come up with alternative projections. But all the evidence available suggests weather plays a role with coronavirus transmission, but only a small one.
Here is how those predictions look in every U.S. county for the next year.In New York City, weather could reduce the rate of infections by a quarter during the hottest months. But by winter, those benefits likewise fade, when cold weather could boost transmissions slightly.Headed into summer, governors have already signaled their eagerness to give up social distancing and reopen their economies before passing the White House’s own guidelines for testing and new infections. The warm weather effects could help justify those decisions in the short term, as governors point to falling infections as a sign that the virus is defeated.“Basing policy decisions on the assumption of seasonality is dangerous,” said Anice Lowen, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University, which was not affiliated with this study. “Possibly we’ll see slower spread in the summer, but even that summer spread could seed the virus in a quiet way, and then come winter it would be a bigger problem than it would have been.”There are some silver linings, however. Rather than relying on weather alone to slow the spread, it’s possible that warm temperatures will work alongside other interventions to adequately slow the virus. Here’s how that works:It’s not fully understood how warm weather controls the spread of the virus.
Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who wasn’t affiliated with this study, said that people are more susceptible to infections in other respiratory viruses when the air they breathe is cold or particularly dry.Research has also shown that the hotter it is, the faster some viruses will break down outside of a human host. Scientists have found evidence that this coronavirus dies in warmer weather as well. And dry air helps respiratory viruses in droplets expelled from a person’s nose or mouth stay in the air longer, making them more likely to infect someone else.Some differences may be driven by how people react to the weather. Regions with more ultraviolet light, like Colombia and Ecuador, were associated with higher transmission rates in the study, even though it’s believed that ultraviolet light can destroy the virus. Hazhir Rahmandad, a co-author of the study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, suggested a high UV index could drive people indoors, where it’s easier to spread the virus.“It’s a combination of host susceptibility and viral stability,” Dr. Iwasaki said. “In dry and colder conditions the virus survives better, combined with the fact that host resistance in those conditions is impaired.”As it becomes harder for the virus to find new people to infect, it’s likely that Covid-19 will ebb and flow with the seasons, according to Dr. Lowen, the Emory microbiology professor. But for now, too many are susceptible to the virus for the weather to influence when and where infections will rise and fall.
What has undoubtedly influenced the virus’s spread, however, is the human factor: decisions made by governments and individuals alike. While the weather effects are slight, some countries have successfully controlled the virus.The weather can’t be controlled. But our actions can.",1
"It’s hard to know yet. But there are many things we can do to flatten the next wave of the contagion.Will there be another wave of Covid-19? And if so, how big will it be, and will there be more waves after it?The answer to those questions depend on seasonality, the susceptibility of the population to the disease, the rate at which the coronavirus mutates and how we come out of lockdown.Colds and influenza are seasonal because those viruses generally survive outside the body for a shorter time in high heat and high humidity than in cold weather and low humidity. People also spend more time indoors in winter, coming into close contact with others with less ventilation, so respiratory infections are far more common in winter, although of course they can sicken people in summer, too.But in 1918 and 1919, the years of the world’s deadliest pandemic, the seasons seemed to have little impact on the influenza.That pandemic had a mild first wave which began in February 1918. It struck relatively few places in the United States or around the world, followed by a lethal second wave which began in Switzerland in late July and spread rapidly around the world from September to December 1918, hitting the Northern and Southern Hemispheres simultaneously. (Australia was hit late; its rigid quarantine of arriving ships delayed the pandemic’s arrival until January 1919, the middle of its summer.) Then a third wave began in February 1919, marking two distinct pandemic waves in the same influenza season, a highly unusual occurrence.Susceptibility clearly was a more important factor than the seasons, because it turned out that the entire world — young and old people on every continent — was susceptible to the disease.Mutation was also an important factor. It probably accounts for the timing of the third wave in 1919: It seems likely that by then, the virus had changed enough that any immunity to the initial virus didn’t protect well against its mutated form. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that exposure to the first wave provided up to 89 percent protection against second wave illness (the best vaccine in the last 15 years provided 62 percent protection), but neither first nor second wave exposure protected against that third wave.What does all this mean now?Nothing is certain and little is known about Covid-19, but a few things are likely.First, modelers estimate that the true number of infected persons is up to 20 times the reported number, which still leaves about 95 percent of the population susceptible. If, as in 1918, susceptibility proves more important than seasonal influences, hot weather will not give as much relief as hoped for. By the same token, that would mean the expected seasonal surge when colder weather arrives might not be as large as feared.Second, Covid-19 mutates much more slowly than influenza, and its key spike protein — the part of the virus that attaches to cells — seems particularly stable. Amid all of the bad news that this virus has brought, this characteristic of the virus is a silver lining in several ways.Since the virus does not mutate nearly as fast as influenza, this reduces almost to zero the chance that it will become more virulent, as happened in 1918. Moreover, because the spike protein is a key part of the virus likely to be recognized by the immune system, then mutation will probably not account for a new wave soon. For the same reason, the consensus view of virologists seems to be that those who recover from the illness probably develop immunity lasting a year and possibly longer, and that a vaccine will most likely protect reasonably well against Covid-19.Third, the incubation period, on average nearly six days, is roughly triple the average incubation period of influenza, and the disease itself takes much longer for people to recover from and stop shedding virus. Therefore even without social distancing it would take months for the outbreak to pass through a community, as opposed to six to 10 weeks for influenza. With social distancing — necessary to reduce deaths by keeping hospitals from being overwhelmed — it will take even longer. Additionally, the incubation period allows an asymptomatic person more opportunity to spread disease.But these factors will give the country more time to expand testing and contact tracing, and to isolate and quarantine contacts. All of those are impossible with fast-spreading influenza.How then do we restart the economy? We cannot simply wait for herd immunity to develop from natural infection. That would take many months and be accompanied by an unacceptable death toll. Nor can we wait a year or more for a vaccine.Instead, a consensus has formed among public health experts to continue current measures until the epidemic curve bends significantly downward and the stress on health care is alleviated, followed by a phased-in approach guarded by, in effect, a public health army. That army would be fighting a guerrilla war, armed with tests, tracing, isolation and quarantine to search and destroy inevitable flare-ups.This approach has worked around the world. It will work here. Covid-19 would continue to spread, but the cases would be in manageable numbers. We would see not so much distinct waves as continuous, undulating swells, broken by occasional angry whitecaps.But if we do not manage our public health response well — for instance, allowing a widespread lifting of restrictions too quickly — we could generate a storm surge that washes away everything gained so far by so much sacrifice. That seems to be what too many politicians seem willing to risk.Those politicians should consider this: In 1918, San Antonio was one of the slowest cities to close, yet one of the quickest to reopen. As a consequence, more than half of the city’s population got sick, and almost every household had at least one person ill. And Covid-19 is more contagious than influenza.It’s past time we start doing things the right way. We still lack the testing capacity and anything approaching the necessary public health army. It’s past time we start building both.",1
"Nature may help diminish the pandemic if aggressive measures to control the spread of infections continue, experts say. That doesn’t mean the virus won’t return.Communities living in warmer places appear to have a comparative advantage to slow the transmission of coronavirus infections, according to an early analysis by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The researchers found that most coronavirus transmissions had occurred in regions with low temperatures, between 37.4 and 62.6 degrees Fahrenheit (or 3 and 17 degrees Celsius).While countries with equatorial climates and those in the Southern Hemisphere, currently in the middle of summer, have reported coronavirus cases, regions with average temperatures above 64.4 degrees Fahrenheit (or 18 degrees Celsius) account for fewer than 6 percent of global cases so far.“Wherever the temperatures were colder, the number of the cases started increasing quickly,” said Qasim Bukhari, a computational scientist at M.I.T. who is a co-author of the study. “You see this in Europe, even though the health care there is among the world’s best.”The temperature dependency is also clear within the United States, Dr. Bukhari said. Southern states, like Arizona, Florida and Texas, have seen slower outbreak growth compared with states like Washington, New York and Colorado. Coronavirus cases in California have grown at a rate that falls somewhere in between.The seasonal pattern is similar to what epidemiologists have observed with other viruses. Dr. Deborah Birx, the global AIDS coordinator in the United States and also a member of the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, said during a recent briefing that the flu, in the Northern Hemisphere, generally follows a November to April trend.The four types of coronavirus that cause the common cold every year also wane in warmer weather.Dr. Birx also noted that the pattern was similar with the SARS epidemic in 2003. But she stressed that because the virus outbreaks in China and South Korea began later, it was difficult to determine whether the new coronavirus would take the same course.At least two other studies published on public repositories have drawn similar conclusions for the coronavirus. One analysis by researchers in Spain and Finland found that the virus seemed to have found a niche in dry conditions and temperatures between 28.3 degrees and 49 degrees Fahrenheit (or minus 2 and 10 degrees Celsius). Another group found that before the Chinese government started imposing aggressive containment measures, cities with higher temperatures and more humid environments reported a slower rate of infection transmission early in the outbreak.But none of the studies have been peer-reviewed by other scientists, and Dr. Bukhari acknowledged that factors such as travel restrictions, social distancing measures, variations in the availability of tests and hospital burdens might have affected the number of cases in different countries.The possible correlation between coronaviruses cases and climate should not lead policymakers and the public to complacency.
“We still need to take strong precautions,” Dr. Bukhari said. “Warmer temperatures may make this virus less effective, but less effective transmission does not mean that there is no transmission.”Warmer temperatures might make it harder for the coronavirus to survive in the air or on surfaces for long periods of time, but it could still be contagious for hours, if not days, Dr. Bukhari said.Even seasonal viruses like influenza and the viruses that cause the common cold don’t completely disappear during summer. They are still present at low levels in many people’s bodies and in other parts of the world, biding their time until conditions are suitable for infections to spread again.Some viruses have the opposite pattern. Polio, for example, tend to spread faster in warmer climes. And some viruses may have no seasonal variation at all.It will take another four to six weeks before health officials will have a clearer picture of how weather patterns shape the trajectory of the coronavirus, said Jarbas Barbosa, the assistant director at the Pan American Health Organization, the regional office of the World Health Organization that focuses on the Americas.The fact that local transmission is happening across the global south signals that this virus may be more resilient to warmer temperatures than the flu and other respiratory viruses that spread across borders in the past. That is why W.H.O. officials still urge countries to act urgently and aggressively to try and contain the virus while case numbers are relatively low and close contacts can easily be traced and quarantined.“One of the big perils in assuming that the virus is less dangerous in warmer temperatures, among particular ages or for any specific group is complacency,” said Julio Frenk, a physician who served as health minister in Mexico and is now president of the University of Miami. “If people fail to heed the warnings and recommendations of public health professionals, the results will be disastrous.”But because high humidity and heat only align perfectly during mainly July and August in some parts of the Northern Hemisphere, Dr. Bukhari cautioned that the effects of warmer weather on reducing transmissions might only last for a brief period in some regions.“This suggests that even if the spread of the coronavirus decreases at higher humidity, its effect would be limited for regions above 40 degrees North, which includes most of the Europe and North America,” he said.And because so much is unknown, no one can predict whether the virus will return with such ferocity in the fall.",1
"Whatever effect warm weather has on the coronavirus, it won’t be enough to safely drop social restrictions.“Everybody hopes for seasonality” when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, Peter Juni of the University of Toronto acknowledged. Maybe, just maybe, the summer will diminish the spread of Covid-19.
But a new study, by Dr. Juni, an epidemiologist, and his colleagues in Canada and Switzerland, offers very little encouragement for warm-weather worshipers. In countries around the world, his research found, variations in heat and humidity had little to no effect on the spread of the pandemic. Differences in how the disease spread were instead strongly associated with public health measures like social distancing and school closures.Several other studies have found or projected modest effects of warmer climates or the increase of sunlight in diminishing the spread of the coronavirus, but all have emphasized the need for public health interventions.One reason is that most of the world’s population has no immunity to the virus. “This means the virus doesn’t need favorable conditions” to spread, Dr. Juni said.He and his colleagues did a forward-looking study in which they picked 144 countries or “geopolitical areas” around the world and established the conditions that prevailed from March 7 to March 13 in terms of temperature, humidity and public health measures.Then they followed those countries and how cases of Covid-19 grew during the subsequent period of March 21 to March 27, after a 14-day incubation period for infections during the earlier period to cause disease.The countries varied from Canada to the tropics, but no effect for temperature was found. Humidity had a very weak connection to diminished spread, they found. But by far the most important in associations with a diminished spread of the disease were school closings, social distancing and restrictions on large gatherings.
“In our study,” the researchers wrote in the study, published Thursday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, “only public health interventions were consistently associated with reduced epidemic growth, and the greater the number of co-occurring public health interventions, the larger the reduction in growth.”Other studies have reported mixed results on the effect of the weather and sunlight. One from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that humidity seemed to slow the spread of the virus. Qasim Bukhari, one of the authors of that study, said the new report was interesting, although limited by the short time span it covered. He said he and his colleagues “also stressed in our work that public health interventions are very important.”Mark C. Urban, an ecologist at the University of Connecticut, found summer weather, including ultraviolet light, had some effect on the virus and its spread, but said “social interventions have by far the most important effect.”And a short report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded that summer was not likely to slow the virus significantly.All of the studies acknowledge uncertainty and limitations in their findings. And none diminish the primacy of public health measures. Dr. Juni said that given the effectiveness of social restrictions, school-opening strategies should be very carefully planned and tested.“We can’t have schools closed for more than a year and a half,” he said, but it is not yet known how best to reopen schools and what policies should be followed. Mistakes could mean that openings backfire, with devastating consequence for spread of the disease.

"A study suggests that ultraviolet rays could slow the virus, though not enough to wipe it out, and not as a treatment.Will summertime slow the virus that causes Covid-19, as it has done with many other viruses that sow flu, colds and pneumonia? A new study finds that it may, though not enough to wipe out the pathogen or keep the pandemic from resurging in the fall.The study, done by ecological modelers at the University of Connecticut, understands the main natural weapon against the novel germ to be ultraviolet light — an invisible but energetic part of the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum that’s well-known for damaging DNA, killing viruses and turning healthy human skin cells into cancerous ones.“We found that ultraviolet light was most strongly associated with lower Covid-19 growth rates,” the scientists wrote in a publication that has not yet been peer reviewed and that went online late Wednesday. Projections of the overall effects, they continued, suggest that the disease “will decrease temporarily during summer, rebound by autumn, and peak next winter.” But they cautioned that uncertainty about the study’s projected outcomes “remains high.”Indeed, though the pandemic’s spread has varied widely among countries, it was spreading swiftly in some experiencing hot weather, including Australia and parts of Iran.The new ecological analysis suggests that balmy days might aid — though not by themselves accomplish — the goal of social-distancing measures advised by public health officials.Other groups have sought to see if seasonal change would affect the virus that has spawned a pandemic, infecting more than two million people worldwide. Early this month, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences looked exclusively at humidity and temperature and found that they would have a minimal impact on the virus. The panel’s assessment contradicted popular accounts.At the White House coronavirus task force briefing on Thursday evening, President Trump highlighted research at the Department of Homeland Security that found that sunlight and disinfectants — including bleach and alcohol — can kill the coronavirus on surfaces in as little as 30 seconds.“Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light,” Mr. Trump said, speculating on a possible means to fight the virus.While such an idea is currently far from the realm of a safe treatment, life scientists have long been aware that the sun threatens the viability of many micro-organisms.“Sunlight kills most pathogenic microbes quite rapidly,” John Postgate, a British microbiologist, wrote two decades ago in the popular book “Microbes and Man,” published by Cambridge University Press. The lethality, he continued, is principally the result of “the ultraviolet component of solar radiation. Ultraviolet lamps can be used indoors to sterilize the air in operating theaters and pharmaceutical and microbiological laboratories. Even in diffuse daylight there is an appreciable amount of light of the effective wavelength.”During the pandemic, because of the shortage of protective equipment, some medical centers have been using ultraviolet light to decontaminate masks so they could be reused. A small industry that sells ultraviolet lamps as a germicide has arisen, but experts warn of their potential dangers for humans.Many nonscientists — including President Trump — have noted the seasonality of colds and flu and hoped the novel coronavirus would act likewise. Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told National Public Radio last month that he, too, expected an ebb and flow of disease.
“Most respiratory viruses have a seasonality to them,” he said. “It’s reasonable to hypothesize — we’ll have to wait and see — but I think many of us believe as we’re moving into the late spring, early summer season, you’re going to see the transmission decrease.” But in comments this week to The Washington Post, he also pointed to the likelihood that the coronavirus would continue to be a problem in the fall, when it would coincide with the start of a new flu season.
Comparative studies of viruses suggest that, as a class, coronaviruses are especially vulnerable to ultraviolet light because of their relatively large genetic codes. “The more target molecules,” one study noted, “the more likely the genome will be damaged.”Even so, other aspects of sunlight’s effects may also play important roles in whether viruses can easily infect humans — a main one being its promotion of the synthesis of vitamin D, a nutrient that can strengthen the immune system and lower the risk of certain illnesses.The Connecticut scientists — Cory Merow and Mark C. Urban — titled their paper “Seasonality and Uncertainty in Covid-19 Growth Rates.” It was posted Wednesday on medRxiv, a preprint website for health scientists run by Yale University, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, and the company that publishes the British Medical Journal. The site notes that its preprints have not undergone peer review for accuracy and thus “should not be used to guide clinical practice.”Dr. Merow said that although the lethal effects of ultraviolet light on viruses are well-known, he and his colleague were surprised to find a seasonal drop evident on a global scale.Dr. Merow said he and his colleague had mined existing studies on how environmental and ecological factors correlate with virus infection rates and used them in ecological modeling of the global repercussions. Global data on temperatures, humidity, the penetration through the atmosphere of sunlight’s ultraviolet rays, population ages and densities, and Covid-19 infection counts were combined into a computer model that mapped out the seasonal trends, he said.
Dr. Merow noted that the study’s range of uncertainty was considerable, such that, depending on the location within the United States, the chance of seeing no viral slowdown in the summer ranged from 20 percent to 40 percent.“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” he said of the reported seasonality.Even if coronavirus cases decline in the summer as his model projects, Dr. Merow said, social distancing and other health public measures would still be necessary.In some circumstances, Dr. Merow noted, summer days would offer no protection at all. For instance, window glass blocks ultraviolet rays. “If everybody sits next to one another on the bus and coughs,” he said, “ultraviolet light is not going to protect you.”",1
"Last week, a medical journal reported that a business traveler from China had infected at least one person in Germany with the spreading coronavirus even though she had no symptoms. It was decisive evidence that the virus could transmit undetected and a critical piece of information, one of the key factors U.S. officials weighed when formulating unprecedented quarantines and travel restrictions announced by health officials at the White House.
Now, interviews with the woman have revealed a fundamental mistake in the report, which appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. It turns out the woman did have symptoms while she was in Germany. They were “mild unspecific symptoms,” including back pain, for which she took a fever-reducing Tylenol-like drug, according to Marieke Degen, a spokeswoman for the Robert Koch Institute, a German research organization and governmental public health agency that was following up on the case.The revelation underscores how the urgency to make sweeping public health decisions about the spread of the coronavirus is clashing with the uncertainties surrounding a novel virus. The essential question public health experts are grappling with is how easily the virus spreads, particularly from people who have mild symptoms. Despite the error in the report from Germany, first reported by Science magazine, it’s still possible that people can spread it before they have symptoms. Public health measures that depend on isolating people who could transmit the virus could become difficult to implement if the virus spreads before people realize they have been infected.The new information could intensify an already challenging public health situation, experts said. The United States imposed wide-ranging quarantine and isolation measures that took effect Sunday, including barring non-U.S. citizens who recently visited from China from entering the United States. U.S. officials will also quarantine Americans who visited Hubei province, where the outbreak began, for 14 days.Hundreds of Americans were evacuated from Wuhan on a pair of U.S. charter flights that took off from the coronavirus hot zone Tuesday night, the State Department said. The passengers will arrive in the United States Wednesday and will be quarantined for 14 days on four military bases, U.S. officials said.
“We can’t isolate everyone who has a headache and took a Tylenol,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. If there is spread of disease when someone is not yet showing signs of illness, “it becomes a considerably bigger public health challenge,” he said. “The isolation of ill cases would not be effective if there’s transmission to a considerable degree before people are really sick.”leaped on the error to inform the public on their website that the evidence the virus could spread without symptoms was not based on science. The World Health Organization issued a report saying it is “aware of possible transmission” before symptoms but noted that study is ongoing of the “few instances” in which it may have occurred.Nine countries outside China have confirmed 27 instances of human-to-human transmission of the infection, WHO officials said Tuesday during an executive board meeting at their headquarters in Geneva, a worrisome sign for containment of the disease.In China, cases continue to soar. Chinese officials on Tuesday reported a total of 20,438 confirmed cases of infection — an increase of 3,235 from Monday, the biggest daily jump since the National Health Commission began releasing statistics. Almost 3,000 of the infected are in critical condition.WHO officials also presented additional information about symptoms of the disease, saying that 2 to 3 percent of patients also have gastrointestinal problems. The most common symptoms are fever and cough, officials have said.The WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency on Thursday and warned countries against imposing travel and trade restrictions on China. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated that call Tuesday, noting that 22 countries have reported such restrictions. The United States is one of them.“Such restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit,” he said. In countries that have imposed them, he called for them to be short, proportionate to the public health risks, and reassessed regularly.He chided “some high-income countries” with confirmed cases that are “well behind” in sharing complete data about their cases. “I don’t think it’s because they lack capacity,” he said. Without better data, it’s difficult for the WHO to assess how the outbreak is evolving or what impact it could have.Hong Kong became the second place outside mainland China to report a fatality, after China reported 425 deaths, bringing the overall toll to 427. A 39-year-old man who died had a preexisting condition and had traveled to Wuhan last month. He was hospitalized Friday.More infections were announced outside China, including six more in both Thailand and Singapore, suggesting that the virus is gaining steam internationally.In the United States, the top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention overseeing the coronavirus response has cited the NEJM report about asymptomatic transmission as one of several “worrisome data points” about a serious public health situation.“We are aware of the correction to the NEJM article on asymptomatic transmission, and the fact that this patient did have mild symptoms is consistent with what we know of other cases,” CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said Tuesday.She said the “enhanced response posture” of the federal government is based on “a dramatic increase in the number of cases reported, supporting efficient person-to-person spread, the geographic expansion of the outbreak, and continued reports of severe illness including those resulting in death.”Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has often been the official called on by the past six presidents to explain outbreaks to the American public, said he still believes it is possible for the virus to spread from someone who is not showing symptoms. Fauci initially said the report had served as an important confirmation of rumors and anecdotes that had been filtering in from China, and he mentioned it at a White House briefing on Friday.“One of the problems with when the virus is transmitted in an asymptomatic way and has its implications — it puts a terrible burden on the screening process. How do you screen somebody?” Fauci said last week, when referencing the NEJM report. “You know, remember back with Ebola? Ebola doesn’t get transmitted unless you’re actively very ill, and you know that. It’s very, very clear.”Upon learning of the journal error, Fauci said he called a top public health official and scientist in Beijing who told him that the disease could spread without symptoms.“I think it’s a double-edged sword. I think it’s important to get information out quickly when you’re dealing with an emerging and evolving public health issue, but there is a danger in that, and we have just seen now a classic example of this danger,” Fauci said Tuesday. But he said his conversation made him confident that while the report was incorrect, the phenomenon it described is real.Patients often recall their symptoms differently when multiple people ask them, said Trish Perl, chief of infectious diseases and geographic medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center, who has fought other respiratory virus outbreaks, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which also emerged in China and infected about 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 between 2002 and 2003.“Stuff you might not consider a symptom, like a little bit of a runny nose, is something people kind of ignore,” she said.The information about the German case was published Thursday as a letter in the NEJM, which — like other scientific and medical journals — has promised to make emerging scientific information available rapidly. That speed has been praised because sharing information is essential in a public health emergency, but also opens the door for more errors.Julia Morin, a spokeswoman, said that the NEJM “is looking into the matter” but that the journal has not posted a correction or update. Degen, at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, said its researchers had submitted its findings, and “it is still open when (and in which journal) this will be scientifically published.” The main author of the letter did not immediately respond to questions about the report.The report could still have value, experts said, because it shows that a person with mild symptoms can transmit the illness initially.Lipsitch added that public policy should be flexible in the face of an emerging threat, to take into account information that may change or evolve. The travel restrictions announced by the White House late last week stated that policy should be reevaluated at least every 15 days.
Lauren Ancel Meyers, a mathematical epidemiologist at the University of Texas at Austin, said she is gearing up to simulate scenarios in which the disease spreads in the United States to help with preparation and planning for countermeasures. But much depends on information that is still murky: how soon people can begin to spread the virus after contracting it, how readily it spreads and other factors.“There is so much uncertainty, and the information is changing every day about what is going on with the virus,” Meyers said.",1
"A new report, sent to the White House science adviser, says the country should not rely on warm weather to stop contagion.The homebound and virus-wary across the Northern Hemisphere, from President Trump to cooped-up schoolchildren, have clung to the possibility that the coronavirus pandemic will fade in hot weather, as some viral diseases do.But the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, in a public report sent to the White House, has said, in effect: Don’t get your hopes up. After reviewing a variety of research reports, a panel concluded that the studies, of varying quality of evidence, do not offer a basis to believe that summer weather will interfere with the spread of the coronavirus.The pandemic may lessen because of social distancing and other measures, but the evidence so far does not inspire confidence in the benefits of sun and humidity.  The report, sent to Kelvin Droegemeier, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House and acting director of the National Science Foundation, was a brief nine-page communication known as a rapid expert consultation.Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California and a member of the Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats at the National Academies, said: “Given current data, we believe that the pandemic likely will not diminish because of summer, and we should be careful not to base policies and strategies around the hope that it will.”“We might very well see a reduction in spread in the beginning of the summer,” he added, “but we have to be careful not to put that down to a changing climate — it is plausible that such a reduction could be due to other measures put in place.”Human behavior will be most important. Dr. David Relman, who studies host-microbe interactions at Stanford, said if a human coughs or sneezes enough virus “close enough to the next susceptible person, then temperature and humidity just won’t matter that much.”The report from the National Academies, independent agencies that advise the government and the public, cited a small number of well-controlled laboratory studies that show that high temperature and humidity can diminish the ability of the novel coronavirus to survive in the environment. But the report noted the studies had limitations that made them less than conclusive.It also noted that although some reports showed pandemic growth rates peaking in colder conditions, those studies were short and limited. A preliminary finding in one such study, by scientists at M.I.T., found fewer cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in warmer climates, but arrived at no definitive conclusion.“Specially in the U.S., any effect, even in the summer months, may not be highly visible, so our real chance to stop this virus is indeed through taking quarantine measures,” said Qasim Bukhari, a computational scientist at M.I.T. who is a co-author of the study.The report sent to the White House also struck a cautionary note: “Given that countries currently in ‘summer’ climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,” it said.Pandemics do not behave the same way seasonal outbreaks do. For the National Academies’ report, researchers looked at the history of flu pandemics as an example. “There have been 10 influenza pandemics in the past 250-plus years — two started in the Northern Hemisphere winter, three in the spring, two in the summer and three in the fall,” the report said. “All had a peak second wave approximately six months after emergence of the virus in the human population, regardless of when the initial introduction occurred.”On March 16, President Trump said the virus might “wash” through in warmer weather.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases, has expressed different opinions about the effect of summer on the virus, some more optimistic than others. In a live-streamed interview on Wednesday, Dr. Howard Bauchner, the editor in chief of The Journal of the American Medical Association, asked him about the fall, which Dr. Fauci said would be very challenging, after a period this summer when “it’s almost certainly going to go down a bit.”
On March 26, however, in a conversation on Instagram with Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, Dr. Fauci said that although it wasn’t unreasonable to assume the summer weather could diminish the spread, “you don’t want to count on it.”",1
"A vaccine would be the ultimate weapon against the coronavirus and the best route back to normal life. Officials like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the top infectious disease expert on the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, estimate a vaccine could arrive in at least 12 to 18 months.The grim truth behind this rosy forecast is that a vaccine probably won’t arrive any time soon. Clinical trials almost never succeed. We’ve never released a coronavirus vaccine for humans before. Our record for developing an entirely new vaccine is at least four years — more time than the public or the economy can tolerate social-distancing orders.But if there was any time to fast-track a vaccine, it is now. So Times Opinion asked vaccine experts how we could condense the timeline and get a vaccine in the next few months instead of years.Here’s how we might achieve the impossible.Assume We Already Understand the Coronavirus. Normally, researchers need years to secure funding, get approvals and study results piece by piece. But these are not normal times.There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored.“If you want to make that 18-month timeframe, one way to do that is put as many horses in the race as you can,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.Companies with vaccine trials underway.Dozens of vaccines are starting clinical trials. Many use experimental RNA and DNA technology, which provides the body with instructions to produce its own antibodies against the virus.Despite the unprecedented push for a vaccine, researchers caution that less than 10 percent of drugs that enter clinical trials are ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration.The rest fail in one way or another: They are not effective, don’t perform better than existing drugs or have too many side effects.Less than 10 percent of drug trials are ultimately approved.Probability of success at each phase of research, Fortunately, we already have a head start on the first phase of vaccine development: research. The outbreaks of SARS and MERS, which are also caused by coronaviruses, spurred lots of research. SARS and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, are roughly 80 percent identical, and both use so-called spike proteins to grab onto a specific receptor found on cells in human lungs. This helps explain how scientists developed a test for Covid-19 so quickly.There’s a cost to moving so quickly, however. The potential Covid-19 vaccines now in the pipeline might be more likely to fail because of the swift march through the research phase, said Robert van Exan, a cell biologist who has worked in the vaccine industry for decades. He predicts we won’t see a vaccine approved until at least 2021 or 2022, and even then, “this is very optimistic and of relatively low probability.”And yet, he said, this kind of fast-tracking is “worth the try — maybe we will get lucky.”Years and years, at minimum.The vaccine development process has typically taken a decade or longer.The next step in the process is pre-clinical and preparation work, where a pilot factory is readied to produce enough vaccine for trials. Researchers relying on groundwork from the SARS and MERS outbreaks could theoretically move through planning steps swiftly.Sanofi, a French biopharmaceutical company, expects to begin clinical trials late this year for a Covid-19 vaccine that it repurposed from work on a SARS vaccine. If successful, the vaccine could be ready by late 2021.Move at ‘Pandemic Speed’ Through Trials, As a rule, researchers don’t begin jabbing people with experimental vaccines until after rigorous safety checks.They test the vaccine first on small batches of people — a few dozen during Phase 1, then a few hundred in Phase 2, then thousands in Phase 3. Months normally pass between phases so that researchers can review the findings and get approvals for subsequent phases.But “if we do it the conventional way, there’s no way we’re going to be reaching that timeline of 18 months,” said Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology at Yale University School of Medicine and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.There are ways to slash time off this process by combining several phases and testing vaccines on more people without as much waiting.Last week the National Academy of Sciences showed an overlapping timeline, describing it as moving at “pandemic speed.”It’s here that talk of fast-tracking the timeline meets the messiness of real life: What if a promising vaccine actually makes it easier to catch the virus, or makes the disease worse after someone’s infected?That’s been the case for a few H.I.V. drugs and vaccines for dengue fever, because of a process called vaccine-induced enhancement, in which the body reacts unexpectedly and makes the disease more dangerous.Researchers can’t easily infect vaccinated participants with the coronavirus to see how the body behaves. They normally wait until some volunteers contract the virus naturally. That means dosing people in regions hit hardest by the virus, like New York, or vaccinating family members of an infected person to see if they get the virus next. If the pandemic subsides, this step could be slowed.“That’s why vaccines take such a long time,” said Dr. Iwasaki. “But we’re making everything very short. Hopefully we can evaluate these risks as they occur, as soon as possible.”This is where the vaccine timelines start to diverge depending on who you are, and where some people might get left behind.If a vaccine proves successful in early trials, regulators could issue an emergency-use provision so that doctors, nurses and other essential workers could get vaccinated right away — even before the end of the year. Researchers at Oxford announced this week that their coronavirus vaccine could be ready for emergency use by September if trials prove successful.So researchers might produce a viable vaccine in just 12 to 18 months, but that doesn’t mean you’re going to get it. Millions of people could be in line before you. And that’s only if the United States finds a vaccine first. If another country, like China, beats us to it, we could wait even longer while it doses its citizens first.
You might be glad of that, though, if it turned out that the fast-tracked vaccine caused unexpected problems. Only after hundreds or thousands are vaccinated would researchers be able to see if a fast-tracked vaccine led to problems like vaccine-induced enhancement.“It’s true that any new technology comes with a learning curve,” said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “And sometimes that learning curve has a human price.”Start Preparing Factories Now. Once we have a working vaccine in hand, companies will need to start producing millions — perhaps billions — of doses, in addition to the millions of vaccine doses that are already made each year for mumps, measles and other illnesses. It’s an undertaking almost unimaginable in scope.
Companies normally build new facilities perfectly tailored to any given vaccine because each vaccine requires different equipment. Some flu vaccines are produced using chicken eggs, using large facilities where a version of the virus is incubated and harvested. Other vaccines require vats in which a virus is cultured in a broth of animal cells and later inactivated and purified.Those factories follow strict guidelines governing biological facilities and usually take around five years to build, costing at least three times more than conventional pharmaceutical factories. Manufacturers may be able to speed this up by creating or repurposing existing facilities in the middle of clinical trials, long before the vaccine in question receives F.D.A. approval.“They just can’t wait,” said Dr. Iwasaki. “If it turns out to be a terrible vaccine, they won’t distribute it. But at least they’ll have the capability” to do so if the vaccine is successful.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says it will build factories for seven different vaccines. “Even though we’ll end up picking at most two of them, we’re going to fund factories for all seven, just so that we don’t waste time,” Bill Gates said during an appearance on “The Daily Show.”In the end, the United States will have the capacity to mass-produce only two or three vaccines, said Vijay Samant, the former head of vaccine manufacturing at Merck.“The manufacturing task is insurmountable,” Mr. Samant said. “I get sleepless nights thinking about it.”Consider just one seemingly simple step: putting the vaccine into vials. Manufacturers need to procure billions of vials, and billions of stoppers to seal them. Sophisticated machines are needed to fill them precisely, and each vial is inspected on a high-speed line. Then vials are stored, shipped and released to the public using a chain of temperature-controlled facilities and trucks. At each of these stages, producers are already stretched to meet existing demands, Mr. Samant said.
It’s a bottleneck similar to the one that caused a dearth of ventilators, masks and other personal protective equipment just as Covid-19 surged across America.
If you talk about vaccines long enough, a new type of vaccine, called Messenger RNA (or mRNA for short), inevitably comes up. There are hopes it could be manufactured at a record clip. Mr. Gates even included it on his Time magazine list of six innovations that could change the world. Is it the miracle we’re waiting for?Rather than injecting subjects with disease-specific antigens to stimulate antibody production, mRNA vaccines give the body instructions to create those antigens itself. Because mRNA vaccines don’t need to be cultured in large quantities and then purified, they are much faster to produce. They could change the course of the fight against Covid-19.“On the other hand,” said Dr. van Exan, “no one has ever made an RNA vaccine for humans.”Researchers conducting dozens of trials hope to change that, including one by the pharmaceutical company Moderna. Backed by investor capital and spurred by federal funding of up to $483 million to tackle Covid-19, Moderna has already fast-tracked an mRNA vaccine. It’s entering Phase 1 trials this year and the company says it could have a vaccine ready for front-line workers later this year.“Could it work? Yeah, it could work,” said Dr. Fred Ledley, a professor of natural biology and applied sciences at Bentley University. “But in terms of the probability of success, what our data says is that there’s a lower chance of approval and the trials take longer.”The technology is decades old, yet mRNA is not very stable and can break down inside the body.“At this point, I’m hoping for anything to work,” said Dr. Iwasaki. “If it does work, wonderful, that’s great. We just don’t know.”The fixation on mRNA shows the allure of new and untested treatments during a medical crisis. Faced with the unsatisfying reality that our standard arsenal takes years to progress, the mRNA vaccine offers an enticing story mixed with hope and a hint of mystery. But it’s riskier than other established approaches.
Speed Up Regulatory Approvals, Imagine that the fateful day arrives. Scientists have created a successful vaccine. They’ve manufactured huge quantities of it. People are dying. The economy is crumbling. It’s time to start injecting people.But first, the federal government wants to take a peek.That might seem like a bureaucratic nightmare, a rubber stamp that could cost lives. There’s even a common gripe among researchers: For every scientist employed by the F.D.A., there are three lawyers. And all they care about is liability.Yet F.D.A. approvals are no mere formality. Approvals typically take a full year, during which time scientists and advisory committees review the studies to make sure that the vaccine is as safe and effective as drug makers say it is.While some steps in the vaccine timeline can be fast-tracked or skipped entirely, approvals aren’t one of them. There are horror stories from the past where vaccines were not properly tested. In the 1950s, for example, a poorly produced batch of a polio vaccine was approved in a few hours. It contained a version of the virus that wasn’t quite dead, so patients who got it actually contracted polio. Several children died.The same scenario playing out today could be devastating for Covid-19, with the anti-vaccination movement and online conspiracy theorists eager to disrupt the public health response. So while the F.D.A. might do this as fast as possible, expect months to pass before any vaccine gets a green light for mass public use.
At this point you might be asking: Why are all these research teams announcing such optimistic forecasts when so many experts are skeptical about even an 18-month timeline? Perhaps because it’s not just the public listening — it’s investors, too.“These biotechs are putting out all these press announcements,” said Dr. Hotez. “You just need to recognize they’re writing this for their shareholders, not for the purposes of public health.”What if It Takes Even Longer Than the Pessimists Predict?Covid-19 lives in the shadow of the most vexing virus we’ve ever faced: H.I.V. After nearly 40 years of work, here is what we have to show for our vaccine efforts: a few Phase 3 clinical trials, one of which actually made the disease worse, and another with a success rate of just 30 percent.Deaths per year.The number of deaths from Covid-19 in 2020 has surpassed the number of deaths per year from H.I.V./AIDS during the height of the crisis in the 1990s.Researchers say they don’t expect a successful H.I.V. vaccine until 2030 or later, putting the timeline at around 50 years.That’s unlikely to be the case for Covid-19, because, as opposed to H.I.V., it doesn’t appear to mutate significantly and exists within a family of familiar respiratory viruses. Even still, any delay will be difficult to bear.But the history of H.I.V. offers a glimmer of hope for how life could continue even without a vaccine. Researchers developed a litany of antiviral drugs that lowered the death rate and improved health outcomes for people living with AIDS. Today’s drugs can lower the viral load in an H.I.V.-positive person so the virus can’t be transmitted through sex.Therapeutic drugs, rather than vaccines, might likewise change the fight against Covid-19. The World Health Organization began a global search for drugs to treat Covid-19 patients in March. If successful, those drugs could lower the number of hospital admissions and help people recover faster from home while narrowing the infection window so fewer people catch the virus.Combine that with rigorous testing and contact tracing — where infected patients are identified and their recent contacts notified and quarantined — and the future starts looking a little brighter. So far, the United States is conducting fewer than half the number of tests required and we need to recruit more than 300,000 contact-tracers. But other countries have started reopening following exactly these steps.If all those things come together, life might return to normal long before a vaccine is ready to shoot into your arm.",1
"Developing and delivering coronavirus vaccines, tests and treatments depends on a massive financial commitment from the private sector. So does the global economic outlook.The dire threat posed by the novel coronavirus is a function of its speed and scope. Wuhan, China, made its first cases public on the last day of 2019. By mid-April this year, the virus had spread to 185 nations, with over 2.5 million total cases and 165,000 deaths.“This pandemic is of a completely different order of magnitude,” says Richard Hatchett, C.E.O. of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an organization tasked with developing effective coronavirus vaccines.Almost $2 billion in funding for vaccines and treatments has flowed from governments, charitable foundations, global organizations and individual donors. But those resources are not enough — an additional $6 billion is needed by early May to develop and deliver vaccines, tests and effective therapies.
This appeal is not based solely on public health concerns. If adequate vaccines, treatments and tests are not developed and distributed in time, a rolling cycle of lockdowns and distancing measures could ebb and flow for months, if not years, with new outbreaks and economic downturns postponing recovery indefinitely.
For businesses, this could mean a second or third wave of economic contractions. “It’s firmly in the interests of businesses to be part of financing the science that can provide a reliable and sustainable way out of this crisis,” says Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome. “It is the only way we can get the world back to something like business as usual.”As such, Wellcome, a global health foundation that is calling on businesses to donate to research and development and join the COVID-Zero coalition, stresses that every industry sector has a vested interest in supporting vaccine, diagnostics and treatment research.Unprecedented acceleration, unprecedented cost
While the global economic outlook is difficult to quantify at this early stage of the pandemic, current projections remain dire. In mid-April, the International Monetary Fund predicted cumulative global G.D.P. losses in 2020 and 2021 could reach $9 trillion, while the International Labor Organization warned the pandemic could wipe out the equivalent of almost 200 million full-time jobs — a number equal to the population of Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.
Improving those forecasts depends on a comprehensive response to the pandemic — delivered on a timetable far more accelerated than that of any other public health mobilization in this century. The coronavirus is now an “endemic infection,” says Farrar. “This virus — and its colossal impact on our citizens, economies and health systems — will be with us for quite some time. This is not a one-off event. There will be further waves of this pandemic,” he adds. “Investment now is crucial to give us the best possible chance of developing vaccines, treatments and rapid diagnostics in the fastest time possible.”Farrar argues that private sector fundraising is, therefore, a moral and pragmatic imperative: “These financial contributions will save lives, secure jobs and get the world moving again sooner than anything else.”Funding a crisis exit strategy.Public-private initiatives that address scientific and organizational challenges will play an important role in the pandemic response. One project, the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, seeded by $125 million in contributions from Wellcome, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Mastercard, takes a multifaceted approach to research and logistics. The initiative has received millions in donations from the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and private citizens, including the entertainer Madonna.Since there are no drugs yet to treat the disease, the Therapeutics Accelerator is supporting clinical trials for evaluating new and repurposed drugs that may treat or prevent virus outbreaks. It will also streamline funding to remove barriers to development and bring new products to scale in the shortest amount of time, thus reducing risk across the development process and freeing up resources to deliver treatments.Private-sector contributions could play a make-or-break role in numerous response efforts, including injecting some of the $2 billion needed to develop three promising vaccine candidates to late-clinical stages over the next 12 to 18 months. Hatchett calls that timeline “hugely aspirational,” considering the five years it took to bring a licensed Ebola vaccine to market, viewed by experts as an extremely fast response. The donations can also contribute to efforts like WHO’s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund, which funds purchases of essential equipment for medical workers, vaccine and test development, and public-education initiatives.
Private-sector contributions would enable groups like the Therapeutics Accelerator and CEPI to act rapidly. For example, according to Hatchett, funding from business and philanthropic donors would enable the organization’s eight concurrent candidate vaccine programmes to progress at speed — at a time when all candidates with a good chance of success need to be explored in parallel.Once Covid-19 vaccines are proven to work, more funding will be needed for organizations such as Gavi, a public-private global health partnership that addresses vaccine equity, which will play a critical role in cost-effective distribution.",1
